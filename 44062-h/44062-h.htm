<h1 title="">THE CRYSTAL BALL</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />MIDNIGHT BLUE VELVET</h2>
<p>Florence Huyler read the number
on the door. She wondered at the lack
of light from within; the glass of the door
was like a slab of ebony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Just my
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all that, she put out a hand to grasp
the knob. In a city office building, ten stories
up, one does not knock. Florence did not so
much as allow the yielding door to make a
sound. She turned the knob as one imagines
a robber might turn the dial of a safe&mdash;slowly,
silently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Why did she do this? Could she have answered
this question? Probably not! Certainly
she was not spying on the occupants
of that room&mdash;at least, not yet. Perhaps that
was the way she always opened a door. We
all have our ways of doing things. Some of
us seize a door knob, give it a quick turn, a
yank, and there we are. And some, like Florence,
move with the slyness and softness of a
cat. It is their nature.</p>
<p>One thing is sure; once the door had yielded
to her touch and she had ushered herself
into the semi-darkness that was beyond, she
was glad of that sly silence, for something
quite mysterious was going on beyond that
door.</p>
<p>She found herself in a place of all but complete
darkness. Only before her, where a pair
of heavy drapes parted, was there a narrow
slit of eery blue light.</p>
<p>There was no need of tiptoeing as she
moved toward that long line of light. Her
sturdy street shoes sank deep in something
she knew must be a rich Oriental rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such a building!&rdquo; she thought with increasing
surprise. The building was old,
might at any time be wrecked to make parking
space for cars. The elevator, as she came
up, had swayed and teetered like a canary
bird&rsquo;s cage on a coiled spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now this!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Oriental
rugs and&mdash;yes, a heavy velvet curtain of midnight
blue. What a setting for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, for what? She did not finish. That
was the reason for her visit, to find out what.
She was engaged, these days, in finding out
all manner of curious and fantastic goings on.
Was this to be one of the strangest, weirdest,
most fantastic, or was it, like many another,
to turn out as a simple, flat, uninteresting corner
of a sad little world?</p>
<p>Moving silently to that narrow streak that
could barely be called light, she peered boldly
within.</p>
<p>What she saw gave her a start. It was, she
thought, like entering the &ldquo;Holy of Holies&rdquo;
of Bible times or the &ldquo;Forbidden City&rdquo; of
Mongol kings. For there, resting in a low
receptacle at the exact center of a large room,
was a faintly gleaming crystal ball. This ball,
which might have been six inches in diameter
with its holder, rested on a cloth of midnight
blue. Before it sat a silent figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>This person was all but hidden in shadows.
A head crowned by a circle of fluffy hair, a
pair of youthful, drooping shoulders; this for
the moment was all she could see. The eyes,
fixed upon the crystal ball, were turned away
from her.</p>
<p>Even as she wondered and shuddered a
little at what she saw, a voice, seeming to
come from nowhere, but everywhere at once,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is given to some to see. Observe that
which thou seest and record it well upon the
walls of thy memories, for thou mayest never
look upon it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That voice sent a shudder through Florence&rsquo;s
being. Was it the voice of a woman or
a man? A woman, she believed, yet the tone
was low and husky like a man&rsquo;s. As Florence
looked she wondered, for the girl sitting there
before the crystal ball did not shudder. She
sat gazing at the ball with all the stillness of
one entranced.</p>
<p>Nor was the strange girl&rsquo;s perfect attention
without purpose. Even as Florence stood
there all ears and eyes, she was ready to fly
on the instant, but just as determined to stay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>The whole affair, the midnight blue of the
curtains, the spot of light that was a crystal
ball, the girl sitting there like a statue, all
seemed so unreal that Florence found herself
pinching her arm. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it
is not a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant her attention was caught
and held by that crystal ball. Things were
happening within that ball, or at least appeared
to be happening.</p>
<p>The gleaming ball itself changed. It was
grayer, less brilliant. Then, to Florence&rsquo;s vast
astonishment, she saw a tiny figure moving
within the ball. A child it was, she saw at a
glance. A fair-haired, animated child was
moving within that ball. She came dancing
into the center of what appeared to be a large
room. There she paused as if expecting someone.
The room the child had entered was
beautiful. Real oil paintings hung on the
wall. There was a gorgeous bit of tapestry
above the large open fireplace. A great golden
collie lay asleep before the fire. All this was
within the ball. And the animated child too
was within the ball.</p>
<p>Florence thought she had been bewitched.
Surely nothing like this could be seen within
a solid glass ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Just then the voice began again to speak.
This time the voice was low. Words were
said in a distinct tone and all just alike. This
is what it said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit quite still. Let your mood be one of
tranquillity. Look with dreamy eyes upon the
crystal. Do not stare. It is not given to all to
have magic vision. Some see only in symbols.
Some see those whom they seek&mdash;face to face.
You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice broke off. The girl, seated in that
mahogany chair, surrounded by midnight
blue velvet, had been gazing at the crystal
all this time; yet at this instant she appeared
suddenly to become conscious of the change
within the crystal ball. Perhaps, since she
looked at it from a different angle, her vision
had been obscured.</p>
<p>The effect on the girl was strange. She
shook like one with a chill. She gripped the
arms of the black chair until, in that strange
light, her hands appeared glistening white.
Then, seeming to gain control of herself, she
settled back in her place and, at the command
of that slow, monotonous voice, &ldquo;Keep your
eyes on the crystal,&rdquo; fell into an attitude of
repose. Not, however, before Florence had
noted a strange fact. &ldquo;That girl in the glass
ball,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;is the one sitting in
that black chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But no! How could she be? Besides, the
one in the ball is younger, much younger.
This is impossible. And yet, there are the
same eyes, the same hair, the same profile. It
is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she recalled that she was
within the room of a crystal-gazer, that the
crystal ball had been credited with magic
properties, that one who gazed into it was
supposed to see visions. Was <i>she</i> seeing a
vision?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I see that girl as a child when
I have never before seen her at any age?&rdquo; she
asked herself. It was unbelievable. Yet, there
it was.</p>
<p>Could the crystal ball bring back to the
girl memories of her childhood? That did not
appear so impossible. But&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Now again there was a change coming over
the crystal ball. A sudden lighting up of its
gray interior announced the opening of a
door in that fanciful house, the letting in of
bright sunshine. The door closed. Gray shadows
reappeared. Into those shadows walked a
distinguished appearing, tall, gray-haired
man. At once, into his arms sprang the fair-haired
child. All this appeared to go forward
in that astonishing crystal ball.</p>
<p>At this instant Florence&rsquo;s attention was
distracted by a low cry that was all but a sob.
It came from the lips of that girl sitting close
to the crystal ball. As Florence looked she
saw her staring with surprising intensity at
the ball. At the same time Florence, who
read lips almost as well as she could hear with
her ears, made out her words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;that must be my father! My long
lost father! It must be! It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant something touched Florence&rsquo;s
shoulder. As she looked back she saw
only the hand and half an arm. It was a
woman&rsquo;s hand. From the third finger, gleaming
like an evil eye, shone a large ruby. The
hand was long, hard and claw-like. It grasped
Florence&rsquo;s shoulder and pulled her back. She
did not resist, though she might very successfully
have done so. She was strong, was
Florence&mdash;strong as a man. But about that
hand there was something terrifying and altogether
sinister. Florence had studied hands.
She had come to know their meanings. They
tell as much of character as do faces. And
this, a left hand, seemed to say, &ldquo;My mate,
the right hand, is hidden. In it is a dagger.
So beware!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Florence did not resist. Before she knew
what had happened she was out in the dark
and dusty hallway. The door she had entered
was closed and locked against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; she said with a forced
smile. But was that that? Was there to be
much more? Very much more? Only time
would tell. When one discovers an enthralling
mystery, one does not soon forget. Such a
mystery was contained in that crystal ball.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of them!&rdquo; Florence declared
emphatically to herself. &ldquo;It surely must be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl,&rdquo; she thought with a sigh, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
be more than sixteen&mdash;perhaps not that. And
her appearance speaks of money. Clothes all
fit perfectly and in exquisite taste. Didn&rsquo;t
come from a department store, that&rsquo;s sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the look on her face&mdash;sad, eager, hopeful,
all in one. How easy it is to lead such a
person on and on and on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On to what?&rdquo; she asked herself with a
start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;is a case that calls
for action. I&rsquo;ll see Frances Ward first thing
in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she laughed a low laugh, &ldquo;perhaps
I&rsquo;ll take a few lessons in crystal gazing.
Just perhaps. And again, perhaps not.&rdquo; She
recalled that claw-like hand and the ruby that
appeared to burn like fire. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, as you may have guessed by this
time, was back in Chicago. It had been late
autumn when she arrived. So often these days
she had been in need of friends. She had
found friends, two of them. And such wonderful
friends as they were! One, Frances
Ward, had given her work of a sort, a very
strange sort. The other, Marie Mabee, had
given her a home, and a marvelous home it
was. Florence had not dreamed of such good
fortune. And best of all, Petite Jeanne, the
little French girl, was with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s airplane, the Dragonfly, was
stored away. For the time at least, her flow
of gold from France had ceased. Her chateau
in her native land lay among the hills where
grapes were grown. It was surrounded by
grape arbors, miles of them. Some strange
blight had fallen upon the vines. Grapes failed
to ripen. There was no more money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should there be?&rdquo; Jeanne had
exclaimed when the letter came. &ldquo;Who wants
money? One is happier without it. I have
my friends, the gypsies. They seldom have
money, yet they never starve. I shall go to
them. Perhaps I may find a bear who will
dance with me. Then how the coins shall
jingle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise and great unhappiness, she
found that her gypsy friends were now living
in a tumbled-down tenement house, that they
had parted with their vans and brightly colored
cars and were living like the sparrows
on what they might pick up on the unfriendly
city streets.</p>
<p>Disheartened, the little French girl had
gone to the park by the lake for a breath of
God&rsquo;s pure air. And there, in a strange manner,
she had found glorious happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Jeanne never forgot her friends. She hunted
up Florence and made for her a place in
that path of happiness quite as broad as her
own.</p>
<p>Just now, as Florence hurried down the
wind-driven, wintry streets, as she dodged a
skidding cab, rounded a corner where the
wind took her breath away, then went coursing
on toward the south, she thought of all
this and smiled.</p>
<p>Two hours later, just as a distant clock
tolled out the hour of nine, she found herself
seated in the very midst of all this glorious
happiness.</p>
<p>She was seated in a room above the city&rsquo;s
most beautiful boulevard. The room was beneath
the very roof of a great skyscraper. It
was a large room, a studio. Not a place where
some very rich person played at being an
artist, but a real studio where beautiful and
costly works of art were produced by a slim
and masterly hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Had Florence turned artist? She would
have laughed had you asked her. &ldquo;I, an artist!&rdquo;
she would have exclaimed. She would
have held out two shapely, quite powerful
hands and have said, &ldquo;Paint pictures with
these? Well, perhaps. But I was born for
action. How could I stand for hours, touching
a canvas here and there with a tiny
brush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Florence had not turned artist, nor had
Petite Jeanne. For all this, the most wonderful
thing had happened to them. Often and
often they had dreamed of it. In days of adversity
when they sat upon stools and washed
down hamburger sandwiches with very black
coffee, Jeanne had said, &ldquo;Florence, my very
good friend, would it not be wonderful if
someone very good and very successful would
take us under her wing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence had fallen in with the
dream. &ldquo;A great opera singer, or perhaps
one who writes wonderful books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or an artist, one who paints those so marvelous
pictures one sees in the galleries!&rdquo;
Jeanne dreamed on.</p>
<p>Even in days of their greatest prosperity,
when Jeanne had gone flitting across the
country, a &ldquo;flying gypsy,&rdquo; and Florence was
happy in her work, they had not given up
this dream. For, after all, what in all this
world can compare with the companionship
of one older than ourselves, who is at one and
the same time kind, beautiful, talented, and
successful?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>And then, out of the clear October sky that
shone over the park by the lake there in Chicago,
their good angel had appeared.</p>
<p>It was not she who had appeared at once.
Far from it. Instead, when Jeanne went to
the park that day she had found at first only
a group of tired and rather ragged gypsies,
who, having parked their rusty cars, had
gathered on the grass to eat a meager lunch.</p>
<p>Jeanne had spied them. She had hurried
away without a word, to return fifteen minutes
later with a bundle all too heavy for her
slender arms. Inside that bundle were, wonderful
to relate, three large meat pies, four
apple pies, a small Swiss cheese such as gypsies
love, and all manner of curious French
pastry. There were a dozen gypsy children in
the group gathered there in the park. How
their dark eyes shone as Jeanne spread out
this rich repast!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>These strange people stared at her doubtfully.
When, however, she laughed and exclaimed
in their own strange tongue, &ldquo;I too
am a gypsy!&rdquo; and when, seizing the oldest
girl of the group, she dragged her whirling
and laughing over the grass in her own wild
gypsy dance, they all cried, &ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!
She is one of us indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then how meat pies, apple pies, cheese and
pastry vanished!</p>
<p>When the feast was over, having borrowed
a bright skirt, a broad sash and kerchief,
Jeanne led them all in a dance that was wilder,
more furious than any they had known
for many a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; they shouted when the dance was
over. &ldquo;We were sad. You have brought us
happiness. See!&rdquo; They pointed to a dark
cloud that was a flock of blackbirds flying
south. &ldquo;You must come with us. We will
follow these birds in their flight. When winter
comes we shall camp where roses bloom
all the winter through, where oranges hang
like balls of gold among the leaves and the
song of spring is ever in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne listened and dreamed. But her good
friend Florence? She was not faring so well.
Winter was at hand. How could Jeanne leave
her in this great dark city alone?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Just then a strange thing happened. A tall
woman of striking appearance came up to the
group. She wore a green smock all marked
up with red and blue paint. There was a
smudge of orange on her cheek, and in her
hand a dozen small brushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; She held up an unfinished sketch.
It was a picture of Petite Jeanne, Jeanne in
her bright costume dancing with the raggedest
gypsy of them all. On the face of Jeanne
and the ragged child was a look of inspired
joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a genius!&rdquo; Jeanne cried in surprise,
&ldquo;You have painted my picture!&rdquo; She
was overjoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a painter,&rdquo; the lady, who was neither
young nor old, said. &ldquo;Sometimes I succeed,
sometimes I fail. But you?&rdquo; She turned to
Jeanne. &ldquo;Do you know many of these people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne laughed. &ldquo;I am related to
them all. Is it not so?&rdquo; She appealed to her
new-found friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! To us all,&rdquo; they cried in a
chorus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>When, a half hour later, Jeanne bade a reluctant
farewell to the gypsy clan, it was in
the company of the artist. The leader of the
gypsies had been presented with a bright new
twenty-dollar bill, and Jeanne had made a
friend she would not soon forget. What a
day! What a happy adventure!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />&ldquo;JUST NOTHING AT ALL&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The artist&rsquo;s name was Marie Mabee. It
was in her studio that Florence, on the
evening after her strange experience with the
crystal ball, found herself seated. It was a
marvelous place, that studio. It was a large
room. Its polished floor was strewn with all
manner of strange Indian rugs. Marie Mabee
was American to the tips of her toes. Save
for one picture, everything in that room was
distinctly American. The spinet desk with
chair that matched, the drapes and tapestries,
the andirons before the broad open fireplace,
the great comfortable upholstered chair, all
these were made in America.</p>
<p>The one cherished bit from the Old World
that adorned the room was a picture. It was
a masterpiece of the nineteenth century. In
that picture the sun shone bright upon a flock
of sheep hurrying for shelter from a storm
that lay black as night against the rugged
hills behind. Trees were bending before a
gale, the shepherd&rsquo;s cloak was flying, every
touch told of the approaching storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so very real!&rdquo; Florence thought to
herself as she looked at the picture now. &ldquo;It
is like Marie Mabee herself. She too is real.
And the things she creates are real. That is
why she is such a great success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to verify her own conclusion, she
looked at a canvas reposing on an easel in
the corner. The picture was almost done. It
showed Petite Jeanne garbed in a bright gypsy
costume, flinging arms wide in a wild
gypsy dance. In the background, indistinct
but quite real, were wild eager faces, a fiddler,
two singing gypsy children, and behind them
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Marie Mabee had determined that by her
pictures there should be preserved the memory
of much that was passing in American
life. The gypsies were passing. One by one
they were being swallowed up by great cities.
Soon the country would know them no more.
She had taken Jeanne into her heart and
home because in Jeanne&rsquo;s heart there lived
like a flame the spirit of the gypsies at their
best, because Jeanne knew all the gypsies and
could bring them to the studio to be posed
and painted. She had taken in Florence as
well; first, because she was Jeanne&rsquo;s friend,
and second, because, with all others, the moment
she came to know her she loved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very wonderful!&rdquo; Florence whispered
to herself as, after an exciting day, she
sank deeper into the great chair by the fire.
&ldquo;How inspiring to live with one who has
made a grand success of life, whose pictures
are hung in every gallery and coveted by every
rich person in the city! And yet,&rdquo; she
sighed contentedly, &ldquo;how simple and kind she
is! Not the least bit high-hat or superior.
Wonder if all truly great people are like that?
I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>She broke short off to listen. A stairway
led up from the top of the elevator shaft, one
floor below. She did not recognize the tread
of the person coming up the stairs. She wondered
and shuddered. Somehow she felt that
on leaving that room of midnight blue and a
crystal ball, she had been followed. Had she?
If so, why? She was not long in guessing the
reason. Twice in the last few weeks she had
whispered a few well-chosen words in the
ears of Patrick Moriarity, a bright young policeman
who was interested in people, just
any kind of people. Patrick had rapped on
certain doors and had said his little say.
When next Florence passed that way, there
was a &ldquo;For Rent&rdquo; sign on the door, right
where Patrick had rapped.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Folded their tents like the Arabs</p>
<p class="t0">And silently stole away,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she whispered to herself.</p>
<p>She wondered in a dreamy sort of way
whether those people, while they reluctantly
packed a few tricks of their crooked trade,
had recalled a large, ruddy-faced girl who
had visited them once or twice to have her
fortune told, and did they know she was that
girl?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunes!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Fortunes!&rdquo;
Then she laughed a low laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>At once her face sobered. Was it, after all,
a laughing matter, this having your fortune
told? For some surely it was not. She had
seen them seated on hard chairs, waiting.
There were lines of sorrow and disappointment
on their faces. They had come to ask
the crystal-gazer, the palmist, the phrenologist,
the reader of cards or stars, to tell their
fortune. They wanted terribly to know when
the tide of fortune would turn for them, when
prosperity would come ebbing back again.
And she, Florence, all too often could read
in their faces the answer which came to her
like the wash of the waves on a sandy shore:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;never&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do these tellers of fortunes predict?&rdquo;
she asked herself. She did not know.
Only her own fortune she knew well enough.
Had she not had it told a half hundred times
in the last months?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fortune!&rdquo; she laughed anew. &ldquo;What
a strange fortune it would be if all they told
me came true! A castle, a farm, a city flat,
a sea island, a mountain home, a dark man
for a husband, a light one for a husband, and
one with red hair! Whew! I&rsquo;d have to be a
movie actress to have all that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; Once again her smile vanished.
Was there, after all, in some of it something
real? That crystal ball now&mdash;the one
she had seen that very afternoon. She had
been told that visions truly do come to those
who gaze into the crystal ball. Had she not
seen visions? And that fair-haired girl, had
she not seen visions as well?</p>
<p>Once again her mood changed. What was
it this girl had wanted to know? She had
said, &ldquo;My long lost father!&rdquo; Was her father
really lost? Who was her father? She was
dressed like a child of the rich. Was she rich?
And was she in danger?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must know!&rdquo; Florence sprang to her
feet. &ldquo;I must go back there. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again she broke short off. There
came a sound from without. A key rattled in
the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&mdash;someone,&rdquo; she breathed, starting
back, &ldquo;and he has a key!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were frantically searching for a
place of hiding when the door swung open
and a tall lady in a sealskin coat appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Miss Mabee!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;It is you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And why not I?&rdquo; Marie Mabee
laughed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? How startled you
looked!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;just nothing at all,&rdquo; Florence
said in a calmer tone as she sprang forward
to assist her hostess with her wraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anyone on the stairs?&rdquo; she
asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why? Have you stolen something?&rdquo;
Miss Mabee laughed. &ldquo;Are you expecting the
police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; Florence laughed in answer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been having my fortune
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so dangerous?&rdquo; Miss Mabee arched
her brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sometimes I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; Florence
replied soberly. &ldquo;I know of one case where
it cost a poor woman four hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it?&rdquo; came in a tone of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had the money. They told her to leave
it with them for luck. The luck was all wrong.
They vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is an extreme case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence replied slowly, &ldquo;it is extreme.
And yet, in days like these, people,
who might in happier days be harmless, turn
wolf and prey upon the innocent. At least,
that&rsquo;s what Frances Ward says. And she
usually knows. She says it is the duty of those
who are strong to battle against the wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so you, my beautiful strong one, are
battling the wolves? Good for you!&rdquo; Marie
Mabee gave her sturdy arm an affectionate
squeeze. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite all right. Only,&rdquo; she
laughed, &ldquo;please let me know when the wolves
start coming up the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; Florence replied in a changed
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Marie Mabee, &ldquo;how about
a nice cup of steaming chocolate and some of
those rare cakes that just came from that
little bakery around the corner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;Here is one
person who can always eat and never regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; the artist exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful
to be strong and be able to glory in it. On
with the feast!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />DANGER TOMORROW</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, one of your friends has stolen
four hundred dollars!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed,
springing to her feet as Jeanne,
garbed in a plaid coat and with a silver-grey
fox fur about her neck, breezed in from the
night. She had been to the Symphony concert.
Her ears still rang with the final notes
of a great concerto. Florence&rsquo;s startling
words burst upon her like a sudden blare of
trombones and clash of cymbals all in one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend?&rdquo; she exclaimed in sudden consternation.
&ldquo;One of my friends has stolen
all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a poor widow with three small children,&rdquo;
Florence said soberly. Then in a
changed, half teasing tone, &ldquo;Anyway, the paper
says the thief was a gypsy, so I suppose
she was, and a fortune teller as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! A gypsy!&rdquo; Breathing a sigh of relief,
Jeanne threw off her wraps, tossed back her
shock of golden hair, then sank into a chair
before the burned-out fire where Florence had
sat musing for an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne placed a long slender
hand on Florence&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Not all gypsies are
my friends&mdash;only some gypsies. Not all gypsies
are good. Some are very, very bad. You
should know that. Surely you have not forgotten
how those bad ones in France seized
me and carried me away to the Alps when I
was to dance in the so beautiful Paris Opera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence laughed, &ldquo;I have not forgotten.
All the same, you must help me. Mr.
Joslyn&mdash;he is our editor, you know&mdash;sent
down a marked copy of the paper. Above the
story of the gypsy fortune teller&rsquo;s theft he
wrote, &lsquo;<i>This is right in your line</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to me. Until
just now I have been a reporter of a sort,
rather more entertaining and amusing than
serious. But now&mdash;&rdquo; she squared her shoulders.
&ldquo;Now I am to become a sort of reporter-detective,
at least for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jeanne,&rdquo; she added earnestly, &ldquo;you
must help me, you truly must. You know all
the gypsies in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not all. But no! No!&rdquo; Jeanne protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the good ones and the bad
ones,&rdquo; Florence went on, ignoring her denial.
&ldquo;You must help me find this bad one, and, if
it is not too late, we must get that money
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish some people are!&rdquo; Her voice
dropped. &ldquo;Here was a woman with three
small children. She collected four hundred
dollars from her husband&rsquo;s estate. She hurries
right off to the gypsies because one of
them has told her two months before that
she is to have money. Money!&rdquo; She laughed
scornfully. &ldquo;Probably they tell everyone that&mdash;makes
them feel good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she asks them how to invest it so it
will become a great deal of money right away,
and they say, &lsquo;Leave it with us for luck.&rsquo; She
goes away. They vanish. And there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did this so terrible thing happen?&rdquo;
Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the narrow streets back of Maxwell
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maxwell Street!&rdquo; Jeanne shuddered. She
had been on Maxwell Street; did not wish
ever to go again. But now&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, my good friend,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;it
is always so. We come into great good fortune.
We have marvelous friends. Marvelous
things of beauty are all about us. We sigh
with joy and bask in the sunshine. And then,
bang! Duty says, &lsquo;Go to Maxwell Street. Go
where there is dirt and disorder, unhappiness,
hatred and poverty.&rsquo; We listen to Duty, and
we go. Yes, my good friend Florence, tomorrow
I shall go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added mysteriously, &ldquo;when I
am there, even you, if you meet me, will not
know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be careful!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s brow
wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be careful. And now&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne
rose, then went weaving her way in a slow
rhythmic dance toward a narrow metal stairway
leading to a balcony. &ldquo;Now I go to my
dreams. <i>Bon nuit!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; Florence replied as once
more her eyes sought the burned-out fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange! Life is strange!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>And life for her <i>had</i> been strange. Perhaps
it always would be strange.</p>
<p>She did not retire at once. The studio, with
its broad fireplace, its deep-cushioned chairs
and dim lights, was a cozy, dreamy place at
night. She wanted to think and dream a
while.</p>
<p>Never in all her event-filled life had Florence
been employed in a stranger way than
at that moment. She was, you might say, a
reporter, or, better perhaps, an investigator,
for one of the city&rsquo;s great daily papers.</p>
<p>She had walked into the newspaper office
one morning, as she had walked into a hundred
places, just to ask what there was she
might do. She had, by great good fortune,
been introduced to Frances Ward, who
proved to be the most interesting and inspiring
old lady she had ever known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our paper,&rdquo; Mrs. Ward had said, &ldquo;is cutting
down on its playground and welfare
work. There is&mdash;&rdquo; she had hesitated to peer
searchingly into Florence&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;there is
something I have been thinking of for a considerable
time. It&rsquo;s a thing I can&rsquo;t do myself.&rdquo;
She laughed a cackling sort of laugh. &ldquo;I am
too old and wise-looking. You are young and
fresh and, pardon me, innocent-looking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she asked suddenly,
&ldquo;having your fortune told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Florence stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several times a day,&rdquo; Frances Ward added,
&ldquo;by all sorts of people, those who read the
bumps on your head, who study the lines in
your palms or the stars you were born under,
card-readers, crystal-gazers and all the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Florence said, &ldquo;sounds exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be after a while,&rdquo; Mrs. Ward
warned. &ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll arrange it. You&rsquo;ll
have to find these fortune tellers. We don&rsquo;t
carry their ads. Some have signs in their windows.
That is easy. But those are not the
best&mdash;or perhaps the worst of them. The most
successful ones operate more or less in secret.
The way you find these is to say to
someone, a clerk in a store, a hair-dresser, a
check girl in a hotel, &lsquo;Where can I find a good
fortune teller?&rsquo; She will laugh, like as not,
and say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; Then, &lsquo;Oh, yes! Mary
Martensen, the girl who does my nails, told
me of a wonderful one. She told her the most
astonishing things about herself. And, just
think, she&rsquo;s only been there twice! Wait till
I call her up. I&rsquo;ll get her address for you.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And when you have that address&mdash;&rdquo;
Frances Ward settled back in her chair. &ldquo;You
go there and say, &lsquo;So-and-so told me about
you.&rsquo; You have your fortune told. Remember
as much as you can, the fortune teller&rsquo;s name,
her appearance, the kind of fortune she tells
you, the setting of her studio, everything.
Then you come here and prepare a story for
your column. We&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Looking Into the
Future.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t write stories!&rdquo;
Florence said in sudden dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Mrs. Ward laughed.
&ldquo;Just tell a reporter all about it and he&rsquo;ll
write it up. It will be a new and popular
newspaper feature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Looking Into the Future!</i>&rdquo; she repeated softly.
&ldquo;If you do your work well, as I know you
will, the feature is sure to prove a success
from the start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But let me warn you!&rdquo; Her voice dropped.
&ldquo;You will find it not only interesting and
thrilling, but dangerous as well, for some fortune
tellers are wolves. They rob the poor
people by leading them on and on. These
must be exposed. And, though we will conceal
your identity as much as possible, there
are likely to be times when these people will
suspect you. If this&mdash;&rdquo; she looked at Florence
earnestly, &ldquo;if this is too terrifying, now
is the time to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence had not &ldquo;said so.&rdquo; She had taken
the position. Her column had been popular
from the start. And now, as she sat there
before the fire in the studio, recalling the
words of Frances Ward, &ldquo;not only interesting,
but dangerous,&rdquo; she repeated that last
word, &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a tiny spirit seemed to take
up the refrain and whisper in her ear, &ldquo;Dangerous.
That is the place! The midnight
blue room is for you a place of peril. If you
go there tomorrow, you are in for it! You
can never turn back until you have found the
end of the road which winds on and on, far
and far away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; she whispered as she rose to
fling her strong arms wide, &ldquo;tomorrow I shall
return to that place of midnight blue draperies,
and I shall ask someone there to teach
me how to read fortunes by gazing into the
crystal ball.&rdquo; There was a new fire in her eye
as she mounted the narrow stairs to enter
the chamber which the great artist had so
graciously set aside for her use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE &ldquo;TIGER WOMAN&rdquo;</h2>
<p>For Florence fortune telling had always
held a certain fascination, not unmixed
with fear. Very early in life she had lived
for some time with an aunt. Always now, as
she closed her eyes, she could see that aunt,
straight-lipped, diligent, at times friendly, but
always holding close to what she believed
was &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; Often, too, she seemed to hear
her say, &ldquo;Cards, all playing cards, belong to
the Devil. They are of very ancient origin,
almost as old as Satan himself. The first
cards were made for the purpose of fortune
telling. Fortune telling, when it is not pure
fraud, belongs to the Devil. Remember Saul.
Think how, when he was going to battle he
slipped away to that wicked witch. He asked
her to tell him how the battle would go.
Well, he found out, but little pleasure it
brought him! He lost his throne and his head
the very next day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Florence did not believe all this, nor did
she entirely disbelieve it. She tried to look
at things calmly and clearly, then decide for
herself. All the same, she shuddered as next
day she tapped lightly at the door behind
which a room was shrouded in midnight blue,
and where a crystal ball shone dully.</p>
<p>She smiled in spite of herself as the door
opened only a crack and a pair of suspicious
inquiring eyes peered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to hide,&rdquo; was the thought that
came to her. But was this quite fair? There
were policemen always loitering about in the
hallway of her own newspaper office. Perhaps
all of life was a little dangerous these
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marian Stanley sent me,&rdquo; she hastened to
say before the door might close. &ldquo;She is the
night clerk at the Dunbar Hotel. She told
me about you, how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; The door was wide
open now. Before her stood a short, stout
woman with strangely tawny hair. &ldquo;Like a
tiger&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Florence thought, &ldquo;and I believe it&rsquo;s
a genuine shade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to learn about crystal gazing,&rdquo;
she said as she entered the room of midnight
blue. &ldquo;Is&mdash;is it frightfully difficult?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To learn?&rdquo; The Tiger Lady, as Florence
was to call her, elevated her eyebrows. &ldquo;A
certain way, it is not difficult. But to go far,
very far, as I have done&mdash;&rdquo; the Tiger Woman
sighed. &ldquo;Ah, that is a matter of years. Then,
too, there are secrets, deep secrets.&rdquo; Her
voice took on an air of mystery. &ldquo;Secrets regarding
the meaning of light, sound, and
feelings; secrets regarding the moon and the
stars, which we who have journeyed far could
not afford to share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you care to go a little way&mdash;&rdquo; she
spread out her hand. &ldquo;Then I am here to
show you for&mdash;let me see&mdash;&rdquo; She pretended
to consider. &ldquo;Oh, you shall pay me two dollars.
Huh? Will that be O. K.?&rdquo; Her voice
took on a playful note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two dollars will be all right. And may I
begin at once?&rdquo; There was in Florence&rsquo;s
words a note of eagerness that was genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she was thinking, &ldquo;is a fresh way
of approach. Perhaps there <i>is</i> something to
this crystal gazing. I may become a famous
gazer. How grand that will be!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; came as an afterthought, &ldquo;I may
be able to discover some worthwhile facts
about that girl who saw those pictures in the
crystal ball. Surely those pictures were real
enough. But how did they come there? Could
her imagination produce them? If so, would
I too be able to see them?&rdquo; She had a feeling
that they had been produced by some
strange magic&mdash;or was it magic? She could
not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo; Madame Zaran, the crystal-gazer,
took on a manner quite professional as she
hid Florence&rsquo;s two dollars on her person.
&ldquo;Now we shall proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She motioned the girl to the ebony chair
beside the table where the crystal ball rested.
Then with nervous, active fingers she began
arranging articles on that table.</p>
<p>Florence was interested in these few objects.
A raven carved from black marble, a
bronze dragon with fiery eyes, and a god of
some sort with an ugly countenance and a
prodigious mouth, all these were on that
table. Madame arranged them about the crystal
ball, but some distance away from it.
Then, as if the ball were a sacred thing, she
lifted it with great care to place it in a saucer-like
receptacle over which a bronze eagle perpetually
hovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>The girl was much interested in the gazer&rsquo;s
hands. In her wanderings about the city in
search of fortune telling facts, she had picked
up interesting bits about hands. She was
convinced that long slender fingers belonged
to a person of a nervous and artistic temperament
and that a very broad hand told of
force coupled with great determination. Madame&rsquo;s
hand was fairly broad, but her fingers
were not long. Instead they were short and
curved. &ldquo;Like the claws of some great cat,&rdquo;
the girl thought with a shudder. Never had
she seen fingers that seemed better suited to
clawing in hoards of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she would not care how she came by
it,&rdquo; Florence thought. And yet, how could
she be sure of that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Madame said in a changed tone,
&ldquo;look at the crystal. Concentrate. There is
no spirit moving in the crystal. You need not
draw one out. The pictures of past and future
you are to see by gazing in the crystal
are to come from within your own mind, or
shall come to you from the spirit world outside
the crystal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do not stare. Relax. Look quietly at the
crystal. In this room there is nothing to disturb
you, no radio with its noise, no ticking
clock, nothing. The light is subdued. I myself
shall retire. You have only to gaze in
the crystal. This time you may see much.
Then again, you may see nothing. It is not
given to all, this great gift of looking into
the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is given you to see, you will find first
that the crystal begins to look dull and
cloudy, with pin points of light glittering out
of that fog. When this appears, you shall
know that you are beginning to have crystalline
vision. In time this shall vanish. In its
stead will come a sort of blindness wherein
you shall appear to float through great spaces
of blue. It is against this background of blue
that your vision must appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready? Concentrate. Gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am gone,&rdquo; came in a tone that sounded
faint and far away. Florence was alone&mdash;alone
in the room of midnight blue and the
faintly gleaming crystal ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />FLORENCE GAZES INTO THE CRYSTAL</h2>
<p>She was alone with the crystal&mdash;or was
she? She could not be sure. Which is
more disturbing, to be alone in a room where
a half-darkness hangs over all, or to feel that
there is someone else in the room?</p>
<p>Only yesterday she had been seized by a
clutching hand and ushered out of that room.
Where now was the owner of that hand? She
had no way of knowing. One thing was sure,
that had not been Madame Zaran&rsquo;s hand.
Those fingers had been long, slim and bony.
Madame&rsquo;s were not like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must concentrate!&rdquo; She shook herself
vigorously. &ldquo;I must gaze at the crystal.&rdquo;
As she focussed her attention on the crystal
ball, she became conscious of two gleaming
green eyes. These were small but piercing.
They belonged to the bronze eagle that, hovering
over the ball in this dim light, seemed
to have suddenly come alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she exclaimed low, &ldquo;what a bother
sometimes an imagination may become! It
must be controlled. I shall control it!&rdquo; she
ended stoutly.</p>
<p>In the end she did just that and with the
most surprising results. Settling back easily
in her chair, feeling the cool darkness of the
place and heaving a sigh, she fixed her eyes
dreamily upon the crystal ball. For a full five
minutes there was no change. The ball remained
simply a faintly gleaming circle of
light. Then, ah, yes! a change came. The ball
lost some of its distinctness. It turned gray
and cloudy. Pin points of light like shooting
stars appeared against the gray.</p>
<p>This continued for some time. Then, of a
sudden, warmth came over the girl as she
saw that gray turn to the faint blue of a
morning sky. Leaning eagerly forward, she
waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; Her lips formed words she
did not speak. The lower portion of that blue
turned to gray and green. She was looking
now at rocky ridges half overgrown with glorious
trees&mdash;spruce, birch, and balsam. Beneath
this were dark, cool waters. Above,
fleecy clouds raced across a dark blue sky.
On the water were no boats, in the forest no
people. She was gloriously alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence breathed, stretching out
her hands as if to gather it in.</p>
<p>Now there came another change. Fading
away as in the movies, half the trees became
bare and leafless. The rocks, the grass and all
the barren branches were bedecked with
snow. The surface of the water glistened.
&ldquo;Winter,&rdquo; she whispered. Then, as a strange
emotion swept over her, she cried, &ldquo;Where?
Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if frightened away by that sudden
sound, the vision vanished and there she sat
staring at a glass ball that was, as far as her
eyes could tell her, just a hard glass ball and
nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; She pinched herself. &ldquo;How
very strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now a change was coming over the
room itself. It was slowly filling with a dim
light. She made out indistinctly a broad,
black, dead fireplace, and above it on the mantel
a great green dragon with fiery eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Then with a sudden start she sat straight
up. On the opposite wall, against the midnight
blue velvet, a shadow had appeared, a
very distinct shadow of a man. Or was it of
a man? The nose was long and sharp. The
chin curved out like the tip of a new moon.
It was a terrifying profile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the Devil!&rdquo; She did not say the
words&mdash;only thought them. At the same time
she seemed to hear her dead aunt say, &ldquo;All
this fortune telling business belongs to the
Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence could not have been more startled
by these words had they been shouted in her
ear. They had been said quietly by Madame
Zaran. She had returned. And in the meantime
the sinister shadow had vanished from
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why, I&mdash;&rdquo; With a sort of mental click
the girl&rsquo;s mind returned to her vision of
water, forest, and sky. &ldquo;I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Do not tell me, not now.&rdquo; Madame
held up a hand. &ldquo;Ah, you are one of
those who are fortunate! It is given to very
few that they shall see visions in the crystal
ball on the very first time of their trying.
You will go far. You must come again and
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame&rsquo;s hands were in motion. Florence
fancied she could see those claw-like fingers
raking in piles of crisp new greenbacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I may be doing her a grave injustice,&rdquo;
she reproved herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall return,&rdquo; she found herself saying
to Madame Zaran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing what she did, the girl let
herself out of the room, caught the elevator,
and next moment found herself in the bright
sunlight, which, after all that midnight blue
darkness and air of mystery, seemed very
strange indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for Sandy and his glass box,&rdquo;
she thought to herself when her mind
had become accustomed to the world of
solid reality about her. Sandy was her youthful
red-headed reporter. Sandy was her
&ldquo;ghost writer.&rdquo; She supplied the material of
her own column, &ldquo;Looking Into the Future.&rdquo;
It was Sandy who pounded it all into form
on his trusty typewriter. His &ldquo;glass box,&rdquo; as
she laughingly called it, was an office on the
sixth floor of the newspaper office building
that looked down upon the city&rsquo;s slow, easy-going
river.</p>
<p>Sandy was not at all like the river. He was
up-and-coming, was Sandy. The instant she
came into his glass box he bounced out of
his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ve got something good today!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Big Girl, we&rsquo;ve got a real thing
here. Knocking &rsquo;em cold, we are. Look at
this!&rdquo; He put his hand on a wire basket filled
to overflowing with letters. &ldquo;All for you, all
fan mail. And the things they want to know!&rdquo;
He laughed a merry laugh. &ldquo;Old maid wanting
to know some charm for attracting a
man; a mother wanting the name of a crystal-gazer
who can see where her long lost boy is;
men wanting a fortune teller that will give
them tips on the stock market. Funny, sad,
tragic little old world of ours! It wants to
gaze into the future right enough. They&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he broke off to exclaim. &ldquo;You
look as if you&rsquo;d seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s eyes brightened.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got a real story this time. I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; Florence broke short off
to go dashing out of the glass box, then started
gliding on tiptoe after a girl who was hurrying
down the long narrow corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s the girl I
saw in that room of midnight blue velvet, the
one who saw moving figures in the crystal
ball. And here she is hurrying along toward
Frances Ward&rsquo;s desk. I&rsquo;ll get her story. I
surely will. I <i>must</i>!&rdquo; she murmured low as
she hurried on.</p>
<p>She was mistaken in part at least. There
are some people whose stories are not to be
told at a single sitting. The girl hurrying on
before her was one of these.</p>
<p>Frances Ward it had been who found Florence
her latest opportunity for work, mystery
and adventure. As Florence thought of
all this now, a great wave of affection for the
gray-haired woman swept over her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Frances Ward was old, perhaps past seventy.
Her hair was frizzy, her dress plain and
at times almost uncouth. Her desk was always
covered with a littered mess of letters,
paper files, scribbled notes and pictures. &ldquo;A
poor old woman,&rdquo; you might say. Ah, no!
Frances Ward was rich&mdash;not in dollars perhaps;
still she <i>was</i> not altogether poor at that&mdash;she
was rich in friends. For Frances Ward
was, as someone had named her, &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
Grandmother.&rdquo; She called herself, at
the head of one column, &ldquo;Friend of the People.&rdquo;
This, in a great busy sometimes selfish,
sometimes wicked city, was Frances Ward at
her best, the Friend.</p>
<p>Because of this, the mysterious young girl
whom Florence had only the day before seen
gazing into the crystal ball and apparently
seeing most mysterious pictures of her early
life, was now calling upon Frances Ward for
advice.</p>
<p>As Florence reached the door of Mrs.
Ward&rsquo;s office, she heard the mysterious girl
say, &ldquo;I&mdash;I am June Travis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was a note of welcome in the
aged woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a
chair? And what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Frances Ward did not so much as look up
as Florence, after slipping by her, seated herself
before a narrow table in the corner of
her office and began scribbling rapidly. This
was not Florence&rsquo;s accustomed place. But
Frances Ward was old. She understood many
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see&mdash;&rdquo; the strange girl&rsquo;s fingers
locked and unlocked nervously. &ldquo;I&mdash;I read
your column al&mdash;almost every day. It&mdash;it has
interested me, the way you&mdash;you help people.
I&mdash;I thought you might be able to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Frances Ward bestowed upon her
a warm, sincere smile. &ldquo;I might be able to
help you. Will you please tell me how? You
see&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled broadly. &ldquo;I am neither a
mind reader nor a fortune teller, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; The girl shuddered. &ldquo;No, of course
you&rsquo;re not. But just think! It is partly that,
about fortune tellers, I wanted to ask you.
Do you believe in them, crystal-gazers and
all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo; Frances Ward appeared to weigh
her words. &ldquo;N-no, I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t, at least
not very much. Of course, some of them are
keen students of human nature. If they can
read your face, understand your actions, they
may be able to help you to understand yourself
so as to meet with greater success. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe they could make you see
people in the crystal ball&mdash;people that you
have not seen for years and years?&rdquo; The girl
leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say that would be quite unusual.&rdquo;
Frances Ward smiled. &ldquo;I should like to witness
such a feat. I should indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can!&rdquo; June Travis exclaimed.
&ldquo;I saw it only last evening, saw it with my
own eyes. I saw my father, whom I have not
seen for ten years&mdash;saw him distinctly in the
crystal ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem quite young.&rdquo; Frances Ward
spoke slowly. &ldquo;You must have been a very
small child when your father&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.
&ldquo;Did he die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Oh, no!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed. &ldquo;He&mdash;he
just went away. But he didn&rsquo;t desert me.
He left money, plenty of money, for my care.
That&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I am so anxious to find him
now. It&rsquo;s the money. There is quite a lot of
it, and I shall soon be sixteen. And then&mdash;then
I shall have to manage the money all by
myself. And that&mdash;that frightens me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Money. Plenty of money,&rdquo; Florence was
repeating to herself in the corner. Strangely
enough, at that moment she seemed to see the
shining crystal ball. About the ball, with
wings that carried them round and round in
ever widening circles, were bank notes. Ten,
twenty, fifty, one hundred dollar bills, they
circled round and round. And, swinging wildly,
clawing at them frantically but never
catching one, was a hand, the Tiger Woman&rsquo;s
hand, the hand of Madame Zaran, the crystal-gazer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />GYPSIES THAT ARE NOT GYPSIES</h2>
<p>While Florence was having a close
look into the mystery of the crystal
ball, the little French girl Petite Jeanne was
not idle; in truth, Jeanne was seldom idle.
She was like the sparrow of our city streets,
always on the move.</p>
<p>Since the artist did not require her services
as a model that day, she considered it her
duty to search out the haunts of certain gypsy
groups, and to discover if possible what had
happened to the poor widow&rsquo;s four hundred
dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; she exclaimed as
she drew on an old gray coat and crowded a
small hat over her gorgeous golden hair. &ldquo;It
is dangerous, this looking for a thief. But it
is exciting too. So there you are! I shall go.&rdquo;
And go she did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Since Maxwell Street had been mentioned
in connection with the theft, it was to that
street she journeyed. It was a bright winter&rsquo;s
day. Wares that had been dragged indoors
during severe weather had been hauled
out again. And such wares as they were!
Rags and old iron were offered as clothing
and tools. There were stalls of vile smelling
fish, racks of curious spices, crates of weary
looking chickens and turkeys, everything that
one may find in the poor man&rsquo;s market of any
great city. Jeanne had seen it all in Paris,
in London, in New York and now in Chicago.
Always she shuddered. Yet always, too, her
heart went out to these poor, brave people
who through sunshine and storm, winter&rsquo;s
cold and summer&rsquo;s heat struggled to sell a
little of this, a little of that, and so to keep
themselves alive by their own efforts rather
than accept charity.</p>
<p>Out of all this drab scene one figure stood
bright and colorful, a dark-eyed maiden
dressed in all the many-hued garments of a
gypsy. Jeanne went straight to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want a fortune told?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes
gleamed. &ldquo;Step inside. Read your palm. Tell
your fortune with cards. Perhaps today is
not so good.&rdquo; She looked at Jeanne&rsquo;s purposely
drab costume. &ldquo;Tomorrow may be
better&mdash;much better. You shall see. Step
right inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne stepped inside. The place she entered
was blue with cigaret smoke. Idling
about the large room, on couches and rugs
were a half dozen girls dressed, as this other
one, in bright costumes. At the back of the
room was a booth, inside the booth a small
table and a chair.</p>
<p>Instantly Jeanne found herself ill at ease
in these surroundings. She had seen much of
gypsy life, but this&mdash;somehow a guardian
gnome seemed to whisper a warning in her
ear.</p>
<p>Turning, she said a few words. She spoke
in a strange tongue&mdash;the lingo of her own
gypsy people. The girl she addressed stared
at her blankly. Turning about, she repeated
the words in a louder tone. Every girl in the
room must have heard. Not one replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not gypsies!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed,
stamping her foot. &ldquo;You do not know the
gypsy language.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not gypsies! Not gypsies!&rdquo; The swarm
of girls were up and screaming like a flock
of angry bluejays. &ldquo;We <i>are</i> gypsies! We <i>are</i>
gypsies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jeanne, backing toward the
door, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem much like gypsies. You
should be able to speak the language&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paveoe, our mistress, she speaks that
silly nonsense!&rdquo; one of the girls exclaimed.
&ldquo;Come when she is here and you shall hear
it by the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does she run this place?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked. She was now at the door and breathing
more easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; the girl said slowly, &ldquo;Paveoe is
the woman who runs this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; Jeanne opened the door,
closed it quietly and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this Paveoe is the woman I
am looking for,&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Perhaps she has the money. Perhaps that
is why she is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>As she crowded through the ragged, jostling
and quite merry throng on Maxwell
Street, Jeanne found her heart filled with misgivings.
A spirit of prophecy belonging to
gypsy people alone seemed to tell her that
this woman, Paveoe, was bad, that they
should meet, and then&mdash;. At that point the
spirit of prophecy failed her.</p>
<p class="tb">Meanwhile, in Frances Ward&rsquo;s office the
mystery girl, June Travis, was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not remember my father&mdash;that
is, hardly at all. And yet, it seems so strange
I recognized him instantly when I saw him
in&mdash;in the crystal ball! And the girl who was
with him&mdash;it was I.&rdquo; June broke off to stare
out of the window and down at the slow-moving
river.</p>
<p>Florence wanted to say, &ldquo;Yes, yes, she was
in the crystal ball. I saw her. It could have
been no other.&rdquo; She opened her mouth to
speak; but no sound came out. She had recalled
that she was there to listen and not to
talk. &ldquo;But what a story this promises to be!&rdquo;
she thought to herself. Then, with a sudden
start she began taking notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June Travis. Plenty of money. Much
money when she is sixteen,&rdquo; she wrote.
&ldquo;Money&mdash;&rdquo; her pencil stopped. She had
thought of the poor widow with four hundred
dollars and the gypsy fortune tellers.
&ldquo;Wolves,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;human wolves, they
are everywhere.&rdquo; Once again her pencil glided
across the paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem a little extraordinary.&rdquo;
Frances Ward was speaking slowly, thoughtfully.
She was facing June Travis, still smiling.
&ldquo;Strange indeed that you should see
yourself as you were more than ten years ago,
and that you should recognize your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a beautiful room.&rdquo; A look of rapture
stole over the girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;A very beautiful
room. Books, a fireplace, everything.
Just the sort of place my father must have
had to live in&mdash;for he must be rich. If he
wasn&rsquo;t, how could he leave me all that
money?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was to come back.&rdquo; Her tone became
eager. &ldquo;He <i>will</i> come back. Madame
Zaran, that&rsquo;s the crystal-gazer, says she&rsquo;s sure
he will come back. She&rsquo;s told me wonderful
things. I am to travel&mdash;California, the Orient,
Europe, around the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But father&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped. &ldquo;She
says she can&rsquo;t get through to father. That
will take money, much money. And very soon
I shall have much money. Only&mdash;&rdquo; she shuddered.
&ldquo;Somehow that makes me afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Frances Ward nodded her wise old
head. &ldquo;You must not forget to be afraid, and
to be very, very careful. I should like to meet
this wonderful Madame Zaran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall meet her!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;But, Mrs. Ward, you are so kind! You have
helped so many. Can&rsquo;t you help me find my
father?&rdquo; Her voice rose on a high note of
appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Frances Ward spoke with all the
gentleness of a mother. &ldquo;Yes, I think perhaps
I can. But first you must do everything
possible for yourself. Where is your money
kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a great bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Frances Ward&rsquo;s face lighted.
&ldquo;What do they tell you of your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;The man
my father left the money with at the bank is
dead. The others know that the money is for
me and how it is to be given out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you live&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a very fine home for girls, only a few
girls, twelve girls, all very nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does the person in charge tell
you of your father?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing at all. I was brought
there by a woman who was not my mother,
a little old gray-haired woman who said I was
to be kept there. She gave them some money.
She told them where the other money was.
Then she went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; Frances Ward murmured softly,
&ldquo;very, very strange. But, my child!&rdquo; Her
tone changed. &ldquo;You may be able to be your
own best helper. You were not a baby when
your father left you. Under favorable conditions
you might be able to think back, back,
back to those days, to recall perhaps rooms,
houses, faces. You might describe them so
accurately that they could be found. And,
finding them, we might come upon someone
who knew your father and who knows where
he has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only I could!&rdquo; The girl clasped and
unclasped her hands. &ldquo;If only I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ward, &ldquo;may take considerable
time, but I feel that it is a surer and&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated, &ldquo;perhaps a safer way than some
others might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she laid a hand gently on June&rsquo;s
arm, &ldquo;you will not go to that place at night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; June&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;We
are never allowed to go anywhere after dark
unless Mrs. Maver, our matron, is with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; The frown on the aged
woman&rsquo;s face was replaced by a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; She turned half about in her
chair. &ldquo;You should know June Travis. I feel
sure you might aid her. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to
take her out for a cup of something hot. What
do young ladies drink? Nothing strong, I
hope.&rdquo; She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; Florence replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always in
training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which every girl should be,&rdquo; Frances
Ward replied promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she put out a hand to June, &ldquo;I
have a &lsquo;dead-line&rsquo; to make. You wouldn&rsquo;t
know about that, but it&rsquo;s just a column that
must be in the paper a half hour from now.
You will come back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;Thank you. I feel
so much better a&mdash;about everything now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Florence as the two girls
walked down the corridor, &ldquo;is &lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
Grandmother.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s truly wonderful. She
knows so much about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added aside to herself, &ldquo;she
knows just how much to say. If she had told
this girl I was engaged in the business of
hunting fortune tellers, that would have
spoiled everything. But she didn&rsquo;t. She
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you visited fortune telling studios
before?&rdquo; she asked the bright-eyed June as
they sipped a hot cup of some strange bitter
drink Florence found in a narrow little hole-in-the-wall
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, often!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve become quite a fan. And they
do tell you such strange things. Honestly,&rdquo;
her voice dropped, &ldquo;Madame Zaran told me
things that happened weeks ago and that only
I knew about&mdash;or at least only one or two
other girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this&mdash;&rdquo; her voice and her face sobered.
&ldquo;This is different. This is what Polly, one of
our girls, would call &lsquo;very tremendous.&rsquo; Think
of seeing yourself and your own father just
as you were years and years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed without hypocrisy,
&ldquo;it <i>is</i> tremendous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it costs so much!&rdquo; June sighed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you tell a soul&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped to a
whisper, &ldquo;I saved and saved from my allowance
until I had it all&mdash;two hundred dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred dollars! Did they charge
you that for gazing into the crystal? Why,
they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not finish. She was trying to
think how much those people would charge
for their next revelation when, perhaps, this
girl had come into possession of much money.</p>
<p>As she looked at the young and slender
girl before her, a big-sister feeling came
sweeping over her. &ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo; she placed her
large, strong hand over June&rsquo;s slender one,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to stick together, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if you wish it,&rdquo; the other girl replied
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; she rose from her chair. &ldquo;I
must go. There&rsquo;s a wonderful woman on the
south side. Everyone says she&rsquo;s marvelous.
She&rsquo;s a fortune teller too, a voodoo priestess,
black, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Africa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Haiti. She tells such marvelous fortunes.
Her name is Marianna Christophe.
She&rsquo;s a descendant of a black emperor. And
she has a black goat with golden horns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Florence laughed, &ldquo;she borrowed
the goat from the gypsy girl in a book
I once read. What&rsquo;s the address? I must
have her tell my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 3528 Duncan Street. I wish&mdash;&rdquo; the
girl hesitated. &ldquo;I wish you were going now.&rdquo;
She shuddered a little. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s black, a voodoo
priestess. She has a black goat with golden
horns. I&rsquo;m always a little scared of black
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, seized by a
sudden inspiration, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you wait until
tomorrow, then I can go with you to see this
voodoo priestess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d love it.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful, this June Travis,&rdquo; Florence
told herself, &ldquo;beautiful in a peculiar way,
fluffy hair that is not quite red, a round face
and deeply dimpled cheeks. Who could fail
to love her and want to protect her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she said, speaking half to
the girl, half to herself, &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t go tomorrow.
How will the day after do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll meet me here at this same hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Then I&rsquo;ll be going.&rdquo; Florence held
out a hand. &ldquo;Goodbye and good luck. I have
a feeling,&rdquo; she added as a sort of afterthought,
&ldquo;that we are going to do a lot of exploring together,
you and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she hurried toward Sandy&rsquo;s glass box
Florence repeated, &ldquo;An awful lot.&rdquo; At that,
she had not the faintest notion what a truly
awful lot that would be.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />THE BRIGHT SHAWL</h2>
<p>When Jeanne left that place of many
gypsies who were not gypsies, she
quickly lost herself in the throng that ever
jams the narrow sidewalks on Maxwell
Street. She was glad, for the moment, to be
away from that place. It somehow frightened
her. But she would go back; this she knew.
When one is looking for a certain person, one
looks into many faces, to at last exclaim,
&ldquo;This is the one!&rdquo; Jeanne was looking for a
certain thieving gypsy woman. She must look
into many gypsy faces.</p>
<p>But now, pushed this way, then that by the
throng, she listened with deaf ears, as she had
often done before, to the many strange cries
and entreaties about her. &ldquo;Lady, buy this!
Buy this and wear diamonds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shoe strings,
five cents a dozen! Shoe strings!&rdquo; &ldquo;Nize ripe
bananas!&rdquo; &ldquo;Here, lady, look! Look! A fine
coat with Persian lamb collar, only seventeen
dollars!&rdquo; The cries increased as she
passed through the thick of it. Then they began
to quiet down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>As she looked ahead, Jeanne spied a crowd
thicker than all the rest. It centered about a
rough board stand. Since she was a small
child Jeanne had been unable to resist crowds.
She pressed forward until she was in the
thick of this one.</p>
<p>Just then a man mounted to the platform,
took up a microphone and began to speak. His
voice carried far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;there
is to be conducted on this platform a dancing
contest. It is open to gypsy dancing girls
only. Let me repeat, gypsy dancing girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gypsy dancing girls! Jeanne&rsquo;s heart bounded.
It had been a long time since she danced
in public. But always, as long as she could remember,
she had danced. By the roadsides of
France, on the streets of gay Paris, in the
Paris Opera, in light opera in America she
had danced her way, almost to fame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now to think of dancing on <i>this</i> street,
before this crowd! Why should I think of it?&rdquo;
Yet she had thought of it, and the thought
would not quiet down. Once a gypsy, always
a gypsy. Once a dancer, always a dancer.
And yet&mdash;she would wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the gypsy dancers?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked a slender girl in a bright shawl who
was packed in close beside her.</p>
<p>There were gypsy dancers enough, Jeanne
saw this at once. They came on, one at a
time. A four-piece orchestra played for them.
Some were bright and well-dressed, some
ragged and sad. Some brought their own
music and flashed their tambourines in wild
abandon. Some danced to the music that
was offered and did very badly indeed.
&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Jeanne thought, &ldquo;are very good.
And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden she began to wonder what the
purpose of it all might be. Then she caught
the gleam of a movie camera lens half-hidden
behind an awning. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be in the movies,&rdquo;
she thought. This did not thrill her. To be in
movies of this sort, she knew too well, was no
great honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>And yet, as she stood there listening to
the mad rhythm of saxophone, violin, oboe
and trap-drums, her feet would not stand still.
It was provoking. She wished she might
move away, but could not. She seemed to
have lost her will power.</p>
<p>Then she once more became conscious of
the slender girl in the bright shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prize is twenty-five dollars,&rdquo; the girl
was saying in a low tone. &ldquo;How grand to
have that much money all at one time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne stared at her with fresh interest.
As she made some manner of reply, she found
herself, without willing it, dropping into the
curious lingo that is gypsy speech. To her
surprise, she heard the girl answer in that
same lingo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are a gypsy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And you
dance.&rdquo; She could see the child&rsquo;s slim body
sway to the rhythm of the music. &ldquo;Why do
you not try for the prize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love to,&rdquo; the girl murmured. &ldquo;God
knows we need the money! And I could beat
them, beat them blind, if only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only what?&rdquo; Jeanne breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I did not have a bad knee. But
now, for me to dance is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>At that moment Jeanne became conscious
of a coarse-featured, dark-faced woman who
was pushing forward a young girl. She recognized
the girl on the instant. She was one
of those girls who, but half an hour before,
had insisted they were gypsies, but who could
not speak the gypsy language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the woman was saying, &ldquo;yes, she
can dance, and she is a gypsy. Try her. You
shall see. She dances better than these. Bah!&rdquo;
She scowled. &ldquo;Much better than these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe she is a gypsy,&rdquo; Jeanne
whispered to the girl beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not a gypsy,&rdquo; the lame girl said
soberly. &ldquo;But if we tell&mdash;ah, then, look out!
She is a bad one, that black-faced woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we shall be very wise and keep silent.&rdquo;
Jeanne pressed the girl&rsquo;s arm. How slender
it was! Jeanne&rsquo;s heart reproached her. She
could win that dance contest in this girl&rsquo;s
stead. And yet, she still held back.</p>
<p>The girl, pushed forward by the dark-faced
woman, was now on the platform. She
danced, Jeanne was forced to admit, very
well, much better indeed than any of the others.
The crowd saw and applauded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is a good dancer,&rdquo; Jeanne thought,
&ldquo;very good. And yet she is sailing under false
colors. She is not a gypsy. Still,&rdquo; she wondered,
&ldquo;am I right? Do all American gypsies
know the gypsy tongue?&rdquo; She could not tell.
And still, her feet were moving restlessly.
Not she, but her feet wished to dance.</p>
<p>And then, with the suddenness of the sun
escaping from a cloud, came great joy to
Jeanne. A powerful arm encircled her waist
and a gruff voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tiens!</i> It is my Jeanne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Bihari, Bihari, Jeanne&rsquo;s gypsy step-father!
She had supposed him to be in France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bihari!&rdquo; she cried, enraptured. &ldquo;You here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter now?&rdquo; Bihari&rsquo;s tone was
full of serious joy. &ldquo;All that matters now is
that you must dance. You are a gypsy. We
are all gypsies, all but that one, the one who,
without your dancing, will win. She is an
impostor. She is no gypsy. This I know.
Come, my Jeanne! You must dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Jeanne sprang forward, at the
same time dragging the bright shawl from
the slender girl&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Here! I, too,
am a gypsy! I, too, will dance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She a gypsy?&rdquo; The dark-faced one&rsquo;s
cheeks purpled with anger. &ldquo;She is no gypsy!
Did I not this moment see her drag the shawl
from this girl&rsquo;s shoulders?&rdquo; She lifted a
heavy hand as if to strike the little French
girl. That instant a hand that was like a vice
closed upon her uplifted arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that arm down or I will break it off
at the elbow!&rdquo; It was the powerful Bihari.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s cheek blanched. Her hand
dropped. She shrank back into the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> a gypsy,&rdquo; Bihari said quietly to the
man on the platform. &ldquo;I am her step-father.
She traveled in my caravan. I will vouch for
her. And she can dance&mdash;you shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps Bihari, the gypsy smithy, was not
unknown to the man on the stand. At any
rate, Jeanne had her chance.</p>
<p>She had not forgotten her own bright gypsy
shawl of days gone by, nor the prizes she
had won while it waved and waved about her
slim figure. Now, in this fantastic setting, it
all came back to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Once again, as she stood there motionless,
awaiting the first haunting wail of the violin,
she felt herself float and glide like a cloud
over the dewy grass of some village square
in France; once again heard the wild applause
as her bright shawl waved before a sea of up-turned
faces in the Paris Opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am not doing this for myself, but
for that poor child with the lame knee,&rdquo; she
thought as her lips moved in a sort of prayer.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that Maxwell Street will not
soon again see such dancing as was done on
that rough platform in the moments that followed.
Jeanne&rsquo;s step was light, fairy-like, joyous.
Now, as she sailed through space, she
seemed some bird of bright plumage. Now,
as she floated out from her bright shawl, as
she spun round and round, she seemed more
a spirit than a living thing. And now, for ten
full seconds, she stood, a bright creature, gloriously
human.</p>
<p>Seizing a tambourine that lay at the drummer&rsquo;s
feet, she struck it with her hand, shook
it until it began to sing, then tossing it high,
set it spinning first on a finger, then upon the
top of her golden head. And all this time she
swayed and swung, leaped and spun in time
with the rhythmic music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>When at last, quite out of breath, she
sprang high to clear the platform and land
squarely in the stout arms of Bihari who,
holding her still aloft, shouted, &ldquo;<i>Viva La Petite
Jeanne!</i> Long live the little French girl!&rdquo; the
crowd went mad.</p>
<p>Was there any question regarding the winner
of the dance contest? None at all. When
the tumult had subsided, without a word the
man on the platform tossed the sheaf of bills
straight into Jeanne&rsquo;s waiting hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered hoarsely to the
frail girl whose shawl she had borrowed,
&ldquo;Take this and hide it deep, close to your
heart!&rdquo; She crowded the prize money into the
astonished girl&rsquo;s hand. Then, as the crowd
began surging in, she threw the bright shawl
to its place on the girl&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&mdash;thanks for trusting the prize with
me.&rdquo; The girl smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trusting you!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed low.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours, all yours! Take it to your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean it! All&mdash;all that?&rdquo; Tears
sprang to the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Jeanne replied hurriedly. &ldquo;This is
the spirit of the road. We are gypsies, you
and I. Today I have a little. Tomorrow I
shall be poor and someone shall help me.
This is life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next instant the crowd had carried Jeanne
away. But close by her side was Bihari.</p>
<p>As the crowd thinned a little Jeanne caught
sight of a forbidding face close at hand. It
was the woman who, a few moments before,
had believed her own dancer to be the winner.
Stepping close, she hissed a dozen words
in Jeanne&rsquo;s ear. The words were spoken in
the language of the gypsies. Only Jeanne understood.
Though her face blanched, she said
never a word in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bihari,&rdquo; she said ten minutes later as they
sat on stools drinking cups of black tea and
munching small meat pies, &ldquo;do you remember
that dark woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a bad one. I wonder if she could
be our thief who stole the poor widow&rsquo;s four
hundred dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, my Jeanne? Who knows?
I too have read of that in the paper. I too
have been ashamed for all gypsies. We must
find her. She must be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jeanne, &ldquo;we must find her.&rdquo;
Then in a few words she told of her own part
in that search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As ever,&rdquo; said Bihari, &ldquo;I shall be your
helper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, Bihari,&rdquo; Jeanne asked, &ldquo;why are
you not in our most beautiful France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Bihari sighed, &ldquo;France is indeed beautiful,
but she is very poor. In America, as
ever, there is opportunity. Right here on
Maxwell Street, where there is much noise
and many smells, I have my shop. I mend
pots and pans, yes, and automobiles too, for
people who are as poor as I. So we get on
very well.&rdquo; He laughed a merry laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And because I am here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I can
help you all the more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />A VISION FOR ANOTHER</h2>
<p>That same afternoon Florence met
Sandy at the door of his glass box. &ldquo;Are&mdash;are
you leaving?&rdquo; she asked in sudden consternation.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get my story in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s O. K.&rdquo; Sandy, who was small,
young, red-haired and freckled, threw back
his head and laughed. &ldquo;I did it for you. It&rsquo;s
gone to press. Remember that psychoanalyst
who wears some sort of a towel wrapped
round his head and claims he is a Prince of
India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He was funny&mdash;truly funny. And
he wanted to hold my hand.&rdquo; Florence
showed her two large dimples in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, I did him for you. So! Come
on downstairs for a cup of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Florence grinned. She was not on
a diet and she was ready for just one more
cup of coffee any time. Besides, she wanted
to tell Sandy about her latest finds, Madame
Zaran, June Travis, and the crystal ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing,&rdquo; she was saying
fifteen minutes later as, seated in a remote
corner of the cafeteria maintained for employees
only, she looked at Sandy over a
steaming cup of coffee. &ldquo;I gazed into the
crystal and, almost at once, I began seeing
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; There was a questioning
look on Sandy&rsquo;s freckled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees, evergreen trees.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s eyes
became dreamy. &ldquo;Trees and dark waters,
rocks&mdash;the wildest sort of place in the great
out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then it all changed. I saw the same
trees, rocks and waters covered with ice and
snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That surely <i>is</i> strange!&rdquo; The look on
Sandy&rsquo;s face changed. &ldquo;You must have been
seeing things for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Sandy grinned. &ldquo;You see,
they&rsquo;re trapping moose on Isle Royale,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isle Royale!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been there, spent a whole summer there. It&rsquo;s
marvelous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo; Sandy leaned forward
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; Florence closed her eyes for a space
of seconds. &ldquo;It&mdash;why it&rsquo;s wild and beautiful.
It&rsquo;s a big island, forty miles long. It&rsquo;s all
rocks and forest primeval. No timber has
ever been cut there. And there are narrow
bays running back two miles where, early in
summer, marvelous big lake trout lurk. You
put a spoon hook on your line and go trolling.
You just row and row. You gaze at the glorious
green of birch and balsam, spruce and
fir; you watch the fleecy clouds, you feel the
lift and fall of your small boat, and think
how wonderful it is just to live, when Zing!
something sets your reel spinning. Is it a
rock? You grab your pole and begin reeling
in. No! It moves, it wobbles. It is a fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ten yards, twenty, thirty, forty you reel
in. There he is! What a beauty&mdash;a ten
pounder. You play him, let out line, reel in,
let out, reel in. Then you whisper, &lsquo;Now!&rsquo;
You reel in fast, you reach out and up, and
there he is thrashing about in the bottom of
your boat. Oh, Sandy! You&rsquo;ll love it! Wish
I could go. Next summer are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week, most likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week! Why, it&rsquo;s all frozen over.
There are no boats going there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No boats, but we&rsquo;ll take a plane, land on
skiis. You see,&rdquo; Sandy explained, &ldquo;our nature
editor has gone south. Now this moose-trapping
business has come up and our paper
wants a story. The thing has been dumped
in my lap. I&rsquo;ll probably have to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The big girl&rsquo;s face was a study. She
loved the wide out-of-doors and all wild, free
places. Isle Royale must be glorious in winter.
&ldquo;Wish I could go along! But I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Sandy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this girl, June Travis, on my
hands. And, unless something is done, I&rsquo;m
afraid it will turn out badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June Travis?&rdquo; Sandy stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? But of course not.
It&rsquo;s the strangest, most fantastic thing! I
should have told you that first, but of course,
like everyone else, I was most interested in
my own poor little experience.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did tell him. She told the story
well, about June gazing into the crystal ball,
the moving figures in that ball, June&rsquo;s fortune
which she was soon to possess, the voodoo
priestess and all the rest. She told it so
well that Sandy&rsquo;s second cup of coffee got
cold during the telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed. &ldquo;You <i>have</i> got
something on your hands. Look out, big
girl! They may turn out too many for you.
My opinion is that all fortune tellers are
fakes, and that the biggest of them are crooked
and dangerous, so watch your step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know my way around this little
town,&rdquo; Florence laughed. &ldquo;And now allow
me to get you a fresh cup of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; Florence said a moment later,
&ldquo;the little French girl, Petite Jeanne, was with
me on Isle Royale. She&rsquo;d like to hear all
about your proposed trip to the island. We
may be able to think up some facts that will
be a real help to you. Why don&rsquo;t you come
over to our studio for dinner tomorrow night?
I&rsquo;m sure Miss Mabee would be delighted to
have you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll be there. How about your
gypsy girl friend preparing a chicken for us,
one she has caught behind her van, on the
broad highway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her van has vanished, much to her regret,&rdquo;
Florence laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the
chicken all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about this story of the crystal ball,&rdquo;
Sandy asked as they prepared to leave the
cafeteria. &ldquo;Shall I run that tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed in alarm.
&ldquo;Not yet. I want to dig deeply into that. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
hoping I may find something truly magical
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t hope too much!&rdquo; Sandy
dashed away to make one more &ldquo;dead-line.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">That had been an exciting day for the
little French girl. After she had crept
beneath the covers in her studio chamber at
ten o&rsquo;clock that night, she could not sleep.
When she closed her eyes she saw a thousand
faces. Old, wrinkled faces, pinched young
faces and the half greedy, half hopeless faces
of the middle-aged. All that Maxwell Street
had been as she danced so madly for the prize
that meant so little to her and so much to
another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;is so very
queer! Why must we always be thinking of
others? Life should not be like that. We
should be free to seek happiness for ourselves
alone. Happiness! Happiness!&rdquo; she repeated
the word softly. &ldquo;Why should not happiness
be our only aim in life? To sing like the
nightingale, to dart about like a humming-bird,
to dance wild and free like the fairies.
Ah, this should be life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still she could not sleep. It was often so.
It was as if life were too thrilling, too joyous
and charming to be spent in senseless sleep.</p>
<p>Slipping from her bed, she drew on heavy
skating socks and slippers, wrapped herself
in a heavy woolen dressing gown; then slipping
silently out of her room, felt about in the
half darkness of the studio until she found
the rounds of an iron ladder. Then she began
to climb. She had not climbed far when she
came to a small trap door. This she lifted.
Having taken two more steps up, she paused
to stare about her. Her gaze swept the surface
of a broad flat roof, their roof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock, and all&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; she whispered
with a low laugh. The roof was silent
as a tomb. She stepped out upon the roof,
then allowed the trap door to drop without
a sound into its place. She was now at the top
of her own little world.</p>
<p>And what a world on such a night! Above
her, like blue diamonds, the stars shone.
Hanging low over the distant dark waters
of the lake, the moon lay at the end of a path
of gold.</p>
<p>Here, there, everywhere, lights shone from
thousands of windows. How different were
the scenes behind those windows! There
were windows of homes, of offices, of hospitals
and jails. Each hid a story of life.</p>
<p>So absorbed was the little French girl in
all these things as she sat there in the shadow
of a chimney, she did not note that a trap
door a hundred feet away had lifted silently,
allowed a dark figure to pass, then as silently
closed. Had she noted this she must surely
have thought the person some robber escaping
with his booty. She would, beyond
doubt, have fled to her own trap door and
vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Since she did not see the intruder upon her
reveries, she continued to drink in the crisp
fresh air of night and to sit musing over the
strangeness of life.</p>
<p>Some moments later she was startled by
one long-drawn musical note, it seemed to
have come from a violin, and that not far
away. Before she could cry out or flee, there
came to her startled ears, played exquisitely on
a violin, the melodious notes of <i>O Sole Mio</i>.</p>
<p>To her vexation and terror, at that moment
the moon passed behind a cloud and all
the roof was dark. Still the music did not
cease.</p>
<p>Awed by the strangeness of it all, captivated
by that marvelous music played in a place
so strange, Jeanne sat as one entranced until
the last note had died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my pretty ones!&rdquo; said a voice with
startling distinctness, &ldquo;how do you like that?
Not so bad, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something of a reply. It was,
however, too indistinct to be understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could anything be stranger?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked herself. She knew that the voice was
that of a young man, or perhaps a boy. She
felt that perhaps she should proceed to vanish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I?&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and
leave all this mystery unsolved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the very next tune chosen
by the musician was one of those wild, rocketing
gypsy dance tunes that Jeanne had ever
found irresistible.</p>
<p>Before she knew what she was about, she
went gliding like some wild bewitching sprite
across the flat surface of the roof. She was
in the very midst of that dance, leaping high
and swinging wide as only she could do, when
with a suddenness that was appalling, the
music ceased.</p>
<p>An ominous silence followed. Out of that
silence came a small voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ple&mdash;oh, please go on!&rdquo; Jeanne entreated.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dash a beautiful vase on the
floor; you would not strangle a canary; you
would not step upon a rose. You must not
crush a beautiful dance in pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; Jeanne was not looking at the
musician.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>With a squeak and a scratch or two, the
music began once more. This time the dance
was played perfectly to its end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; breathed Jeanne as she sank down
upon a stone parapet. &ldquo;I ask you, where did
<i>you</i> come from&mdash;the moon, or just one of the
stars?&rdquo; She was staring at a handsome dark-eyed
boy in his late teens. A violin was tucked
under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; he answered shyly. &ldquo;Up from a
hole in the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you playing here?&rdquo; Jeanne
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came&mdash;&rdquo; there was a low chuckle. &ldquo;I
came here so I could play for the pigeons
who roost under the tank there. They like
it, I&rsquo;m sure. Did you hear them cooing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But why&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne hesitated, bewildered.
&ldquo;Why for the pigeons? You play
divinely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He made a low bow. &ldquo;I play
well enough, I suppose. So do a thousand
others. That&rsquo;s the trouble. There is not
room for us all, so I must take to the house-tops.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you live?&rdquo; Jeanne did not
mean to go on, yet she could not stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I play twice a week in a&mdash;a place where
people eat, and&mdash;and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a nice place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too nice, but it is a nice five dollars
a week they pay me. One may eat and have
his collars done for five a week. The janitor
of this building lets me have a cubbyhole under
the roof, and so&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed again. &ldquo;I
am handy to the pigeons. They appreciate
my music, I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jeanne sprang up and stamped a
foot. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke about art. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the boy breathed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded.</p>
<p>The boy murmured something that sounded
like &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Jeanne spoke more distinctly. &ldquo;I
said, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy too spoke more distinctly. Still
the thing he said was to Jeanne simply &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she exclaimed almost angrily,
&ldquo;whether it is today still, or whether
we have got into tomorrow. My watch is in
my room. What I&rsquo;d like to know is, what
do your parents call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; the boy repeated, or so it
sounded to Jeanne.</p>
<p>Then he laughed a merry laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spell
it for you. T-U-M, Tum. That&rsquo;s my first
name. And the second is Morrow. I defy you
to say it fast without making it &lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;is a very good
name for me! It is always tomorrow that
good things are to happen. Then they never
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tum Morrow,&rdquo; said Jeanne, &ldquo;tomorrow
at three will you have tea with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely will tomorrow,&rdquo; said Tum Morrow,
&ldquo;but where do I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me with your eye until I vanish.&rdquo;
Jeanne rose. &ldquo;Tomorrow lift that same trap
door, climb down the ladder, then look
straight ahead and down. You will probably
be looking at me in a very beautiful studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; said Tum Morrow, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tomorrow, Tum Morrow, may be
your lucky day,&rdquo; Jeanne laughed as she went
dancing away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Tomorrow came. So did Tum Morrow.
Jeanne did not forget her appointment. She
saw to it that water was hot for tea. She
prepared a heaping plate of the most delicious
sandwiches. Great heaps of nut meats,
a bottle of salad-dressing and half a chicken
went into their making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;That will be
a feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded. &ldquo;One
who eats on five dollars a week and keeps his
collars clean in the bargain deserves a feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moods of the great artist were not,
however, governed by afternoon appointments
to tea. When Tum Morrow, having
followed Jeanne&rsquo;s instructions, found himself
upon the studio balcony, he did not speak,
but sat quietly down upon the top step of the
stair to wait, for there in the center of the
large studio, poised on a narrow, raised
stand, was Jeanne.</p>
<p>Garbed in high red boots, short socks,
skirts of mixed and gorgeous hues and a
meager waist, wide open at the front, she
stood with a bright tambourine held aloft,
poised for a gypsy dancer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>To the right of her, working furiously,
dashing a touch of color here, another there,
stepping back for a look, then leaping at her
canvas again, was the painter, Marie Mabee.</p>
<p>Evidently Tum Morrow had seen nothing
like this before, for he sat there, mouth wide
open, staring. At that moment, so far as he
was concerned, tomorrow might at any moment
become today. He would never have
known the difference.</p>
<p>When at last Marie Mabee thrust her
brushes, handles down, in the top of a jug
and said, &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Tum Morrow heaved such
a prodigious sigh that the artist started,
whirled about, stared for an instant, then
demanded, &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the startled boy could find breath
for reply, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, yes! I remember.
Jeanne told me! Come right down! She
has a feast all prepared for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She extended both hands as he reached the
foot of the stairs. Tum took the hands. His
eyes were only for Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>It was a jolly tea they had, Jeanne, the artist,
and Tum. Tum&rsquo;s shyness at being in the
presence of a great personage gradually
passed away. Quite frankly at last he told
his story. His music had been the gift of his
mother. A talented woman, she had taught
him from the age of three. When she could
go no farther, she had employed a great teacher
to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They called me a prodigy.&rdquo; He sighed.
&ldquo;I never liked that very much. I played at
women&rsquo;s clubs and all sorts of luncheons and
all the ladies clapped their hands. Some of
the ladies had kind faces&mdash;some of them,&rdquo; he
repeated slowly. &ldquo;I played only for those
who had kind faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he ended rather abruptly, &ldquo;my
teacher is gone. My mother is gone. I am no
longer a prodigy, nor am I a grown musician,
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you play for the pigeons on the roof!&rdquo;
Jeanne laughed a trifle uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for angels,&rdquo; Tum replied, looking
straight into her eyes. Jeanne flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; Miss Mabee asked,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That angels come down from the sky at
night,&rdquo; Jeanne replied teasingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Mabee,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;what
does one do between the time he is a prodigy
and when he is a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Miss Mabee stirred
her tea thoughtfully. &ldquo;He just does the best
he can, gets around among people and hopes
something will happen. And, bye and bye,
something does happen. Then all is lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; She sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you?&rdquo; said Tum, &ldquo;you, Miss Jeanne,
are a famous dancer&mdash;you must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Jeanne was smiling. &ldquo;I am only a
dancing gypsy. Once, it is true, I danced a
light opera. And once, just once&mdash;&rdquo; her eyes
shone. &ldquo;Once I danced in that beautiful
Opera House down by the river. That Opera
House is closed now. What a pity! I danced
in the <i>Juggler of Notre Dame</i>. And the people
applauded. Oh, how they did applaud!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a gypsy&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped. &ldquo;With
a gypsy it is different. Nothing wonderful
lasts with a gypsy. So now&mdash;&rdquo; she laughed
a little, low laugh. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m just a wild
dancing bumble bee with invisible wings on
my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s eyes shone with a
sudden light. &ldquo;Do you know this?&rdquo; Taking
up his violin, he began to play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she demanded, enraptured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call it &lsquo;Flight of the Bumble Bee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tum played it again. Jeanne sat entranced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Encore!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Then, snatching up a thin gauzy shawl of
iridescent silk, she went leaping and whirling,
flying across the room.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Miss Mabee, who had returned,
stood in a corner fascinated.</p>
<p>And it was truly worthy of her admiration.
As a dancer, when the mood seized her
Jeanne could be a spark, a flame, a gaudy,
darting humming-bird, and now indeed she
was a bee with invisible wings on her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; exclaimed the artist, &ldquo;is a tiny
masterpiece of music and dancing! It must
be preserved. Others must know of it. We
shall find a time and place. You shall see, my
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne flushed with pleasure. Tum was
silent, but deep in both their hearts was the
conviction that this was one of the truly
large moments of their lives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />JEANNE PLANS AN ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>The dinner served in Sandy&rsquo;s honor at
the artist&rsquo;s studio was an occasion long
to be remembered. Jeanne had chanced to
speak of her gypsy step-father, Bihari.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he now in America?&rdquo; Miss Mabee
asked with sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. In Chicago!&rdquo; Jeanne replied joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must have him at our party tonight.
Perhaps I might like to paint his picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are sure to!&rdquo; Jeanne cried. &ldquo;There
is no one in the world like Bihari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bihari was sent for. Tum Morrow too
had been invited and, to help the affair along,
had volunteered to bring three boon companions,
all destitute musicians, and all glad
to provide music in exchange for Jeanne&rsquo;s
gypsy-style chicken dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>When the hour arrived all were there; so
too were the great steaming platters of
chicken with dumplings and gravy. And such
a feast as that was! Bihari had persuaded
two good cooks of his own race to prepare
the feast. And, because of their love for Bihari
and Jeanne, they had spared neither time
nor labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Sandy, as at last the final
toast of delicious fruit juice had been drunk,
&ldquo;is the finest feast I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said to Jeanne, &ldquo;tell us about
this magic isle I am to visit, this Isle Royale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Jeanne looked at him in surprise.
&ldquo;You are going to Isle Royale? In winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. In an airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an airplane?&rdquo; The look of surprise and
longing on Jeanne&rsquo;s face was a wonderful
thing to behold. Her own Dragonfly was
stored away, but never would she forget those
golden days when she had gone gliding
through the air. Nor would she forget the
glorious days she had spent on the shores of
the &ldquo;Magic Isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to Isle Royale in an airplane,&rdquo;
she repeated slowly. &ldquo;Then I shall
tell you all about it&mdash;but on one condition!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo; Sandy smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little cry of surprise ran round the room.
For a space of seconds Sandy was silent.
Then, with a look of sudden decision on his
face, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Jeanne,&rdquo; Miss Mabee arose,
&ldquo;when our good friend Tum has put another
log on the fire and we have all drawn up our
chairs, suppose you tell us all about this very
wonderful isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So there, with the lights turned out, with
the glow of the fire playing over her bewitching
face, Jeanne told them of Isle Royale. She
spoke of the deep, dark waters where lake
trout gleam like silver; of the rocky shore
where at times the waters of old Lake Superior
come thundering in, and of the little
lakes that lay gleaming among the dark green
forests.</p>
<p>She told of wild moose that come down to
the shores at sunset to dip their noses in the
bluest of waters, then to lift their antlers high
and send a challenge echoing away across the
ridges. She told of the bush wolves who answered
that challenge, then of the slow settling
down of night that turned this whole
little world to a pitchy black.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;the moon
comes rolling like a golden chariot wheel over
the ridge to paint a path of gold across those
black waters. And you, not to be outdone by
a mere moon, touch a match to your campfire
and it blazes high to meet the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she exclaimed, springing to her
feet and executing a wild dance before the
fire, &ldquo;that is summer! What must it be in
winter? All those tall spruce trees decorated
with snow, all those little lakes gleaming like
mirrors. And tracks through the snow&mdash;tracks
of moose, bush wolves, lynx and beaver, mysterious
tracks that wind on and on over the
ridge. To think,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we are to see
all this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Sandy!&rdquo; Her mood changed. &ldquo;You
said they were trapping moose. Why should
they trap any wild thing? That&mdash;why that&rsquo;s
like trapping a gypsy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some gypsies should be trapped.&rdquo; Sandy
laughed, seizing her hand teasingly. &ldquo;But as
for the moose of Isle Royale, they have become
too numerous for the island. They are
trapping them and taming them a little. In
the spring they are to be taken to game sanctuaries
on the mainland where there is an
abundance of food. But look!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;We are taking up all the time raving about
this island. What about our musicians? Let&rsquo;s
have a tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were greeted with hand-clapping.
Tum Morrow and his companions
tuned up and for the next half hour the studio
walls echoed to many a melody. Some
were of today, modern and rhythmical, and
some of yesterday with all their tuneful old
melodies.</p>
<p>During this musical interlude Florence,
seated in a dark corner, gave herself over
to reflections concerning the amusing, mysterious
and sometimes threatening events of
the days just past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is all so strange, so intriguing, so rather
terrible!&rdquo; she was thinking to herself. &ldquo;This
Madame Zaran, is she truly a genius at crystal
gazing? How could she fail to be? Did I
not, myself, see a vision in the crystal ball?
And that girl June, who could doubt but that
she saw herself as she was when a child, with
her father? And yet&mdash;&rdquo; the whole affair was
terribly disturbing. They had compelled the
girl, a mere child, to pay two hundred dollars
for this vision. How much for the next?
They had promised to reveal her father&rsquo;s
whereabouts, tell her when he would return.
Could they do that? &ldquo;Ten years!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;One is tempted to believe him dead.
And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was the voodoo priestess, she
with the black goat. They were to visit her
on the morrow. &ldquo;And I have an appointment
with Madame Zaran too. A busy day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought, with a new feeling of alarm,
of Jeanne&rsquo;s experience on that day. &ldquo;Wish I
hadn&rsquo;t told her of that thieving gypsy fortune
teller. Get her into no end of trouble.
Dangerous, those gypsies!&rdquo; Then, at a sudden
remembrance, she smiled. It was good that
Jeanne had won the dancing contest; good,
too, that she had helped that gypsy child of
the bright shawl. Jeanne had &ldquo;cast bread
upon the waters.&rdquo; It would return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Then of a sudden as the music stopped, she
gave a start. Before her eyes there appeared
to float a shadow, a curiously frightening
shadow. It was the shadow of a face she
had seen on the midnight blue of Madame
Zaran&rsquo;s studio, a face that had somehow reminded
her of Satan. &ldquo;My dear old aunt used
to say Satan had a hand in all fortune telling,&rdquo;
she whispered. But then, aunts were
almost always old-fashioned and sometimes
a little foolish.</p>
<p>Now the music played so well by Tum Morrow
and his companions came to an end.
There was instant applause, and Florence
was wakened from her disturbing day dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you play one of Liszt&rsquo;s rhapsodies?&rdquo;
Miss Mabee asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Tum said regretfully, &ldquo;I have
never studied them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes!&rdquo; Bihari, the gypsy blacksmith,
sprang up. &ldquo;Let me show you! The best one
it goes like this. Every gypsy knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the violin from Tum Morrow&rsquo;s
hand, he began drawing forth a teasing, bewitching
melody. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, nodding
his head at the other musicians. &ldquo;You
know this one. Surely you must!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>They did. Soon piano, cello, clarinet and
violin were doing full justice to this glorious
gypsy music written down for the world by a
master composer.</p>
<p>A perfect silence fell over the room. When
the violin dropped to a whisper and was
heard alone, there was not another sound.</p>
<p>As for Jeanne, while Bihari played she was
far, far away beside a hedge where the grass
was green and the midnight blue of the sky
was sprinkled with golden stars. Again, with
her fellow wanderers she breathed the sweet
free air of night, listened to the call of the
whippoorwill and the wail of the violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Miss Mabee exclaimed as
the music ended. &ldquo;You almost make me want
to be a gypsy. And Bihari, you shall make
me famous. I shall paint your picture. You
shall be seated on your anvil, playing Liszt&rsquo;s
rhapsody to a group of ragged children. In
the background shall be a dozen poorly clad
women holding their pots and pans to be
mended, but all carried away by that glorious
music. Ah, what a picture! Shall I have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; Bihari replied humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; the artist exclaimed. &ldquo;And all
the ones with ragged shawls and leaky pans
shall be well paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Tum, my dear boy,&rdquo; she turned
to the boy musician. &ldquo;You give us a goodnight
lullaby, and we shall be off to pleasant
dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">A half hour later Miss Mabee and Florence
sat before the fire. Florence had just told of
her experience as a crystal-gazer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were day-dreaming, my dear,&rdquo; Miss
Mabee laughed lightly. &ldquo;Had you been looking
dreamily at a spot of light or a blank wall,
you would have seen the same thing. You are
fond of the wide out-of-doors and our bits of
American wilderness. Day-dreaming is our
most wonderful indoor sport. Were it not
for our day-dreams, there are many who
would go quite mad in these troublous times.
But when life is too hard, off we drift on our
magic carpet of dreams, and all is well.&rdquo;</p>

<br />A VOODOO PRIESTESS</h2>
<p>When Florence and June Travis arrived
at the home of Marianna Christophe,
the voodoo priestess, next afternoon,
they met with a surprise. The surprise was
not in the building&mdash;it was unpretentious
enough, a long, low building with a pink
front. The surprise came when they found
several large and shiny automobiles parked
along the curb before the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our visit is off,&rdquo; Florence sighed. &ldquo;Must
be a funeral or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have an appointment at four
o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; June protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Florence lifted an
ancient brass knocker and let it fall.</p>
<p>Instantly the door flew open and a brownish
young lady with white and rolling eyes
peered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an appointment,&rdquo; June Travis said
timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look.&rdquo; The brown one vanished, to return
almost at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yass&rsquo;m! Jest step right in!&rdquo; She bowed
low. &ldquo;The priestess will see you, &rsquo;zactly at
four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reception room which the girls entered
was large. Along one side was a row of comfortable
chairs. All but two of the chairs were
filled. If one were to judge by their rich attire,
these people were the owners of the cars
parked outside. They were all women. One
was old and one quite young. The others, four
in all, were middle-aged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s marvelous!&rdquo; one of the waiting ones
said in a half whisper. &ldquo;The first time I saw
her she told me I had a boy who was not yet
sixteen and who was more than six feet tall.
She said I had been married twice, but that
I have no husband now. She said my principal
jewels were a necklace of pearls coming
down from my grandmother, a diamond
bracelet and three diamond rings. All of this
is exactly right. And think of it! She had
never seen me before! I had not so much as
given her my name. Wasn&rsquo;t that most astonishing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Florence listened in vast surprise. This
woman was speaking, beyond doubt, of the
voodoo priestess. Could she indeed tell you
all about yourself, your innermost secrets?
She shuddered. Who could want any stranger
to know all that? She looked at June. She,
too, had heard. Her face was all alight. &ldquo;All
these people believe in her,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;They are much older than I, and must be
wiser, and they are rich. Surely she will tell
me where my father is, and when he will come
back. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s so very little to ask.&rdquo; There
was an appealing note in the girl&rsquo;s low voice
that went straight to Florence&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have ten dollars left,&rdquo; June whispered.
&ldquo;Next week I&rsquo;ll have a little more, and soon
a very great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence thought, &ldquo;and therein lies
your great peril! In such times as these much
money is a menace to any innocent and unprotected
person. We must find her father,
we must indeed! But how? There&rsquo;s the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts were broken in upon by the
brown girl of the rolling eyes. &ldquo;The priestess
will see you all now,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;June,&rdquo; Florence asked in a low tone, &ldquo;have
you been here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; The girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Florence thought, &ldquo;they are
passing her in ahead of those others! Can it
be that this priestess has already heard of this
child&rsquo;s money?&rdquo; For the first time in her life
she began to believe that at least some of
these fortune tellers knew everything, even
the innermost secrets of one&rsquo;s heart. The
feeling made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The room they entered was weirdly fantastic.
Its walls were covered with paper so
blue that it seemed black. Over this paper
flew a thousand tiny imaginary birds of every
hue. The floor was jet black. On a sort of
raised platform, in a highly ornamental chair
that seemed a throne, sat a very large black
woman with deep-set dark eyes. She was
dressed in a robe of dark red. As the two
girls entered, she was swinging her arms
slowly up and down as if to drive away an
imaginary swarm of flies, or perhaps ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;&rdquo; June began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, child. Don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s
tone was melodiously southern. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s a priestess,
a voodoo priestess. I&rsquo;s the great, great
granddaughter of Cristophe, the Emperor of
Haiti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, child!&rdquo; Her voice dropped. It
seemed to Florence that the lights grew dim.
&ldquo;At midnight in the dark of de moon, on de
highest mountain in Haiti, dey took me an&rsquo;
a big black goat, all black. Dey sacrificed de
goat in de dark of de moon. But me, honey,
me dey made a priestess. To me it is given
to ask and to know all things. As I look at
you now, I seem to see no father near you, no
mother near you, but girls, one, two, three,
oh, mebby a dozen. That right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak, honey. You come to ask
where your Daddy is, and I&mdash;I am here to
tell you. Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got ten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of money, not yet. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priestess broke off suddenly. Florence
had entered silently, but had fallen back at
once into a dark corner. For the first time
the priestess became conscious of her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only my friend,&rdquo; June replied timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she can sit over there.&rdquo; The priestess
pointed to the farthest corner.</p>
<p>When Florence was seated the woman began
again her monotonous monologue, but she
spoke in such low tones that Florence could
catch only a word here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darkness,&rdquo; she heard then&mdash;&ldquo;Spirit of
Cristophe&mdash;darkness&mdash;the black goat&mdash;gold,
gold, gold&mdash;spirit of darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as these last words were spoken, the
lights began slowly to fade. Then it was that
for the first time Florence became conscious
of some living creature in the corner opposite
her own. As she looked, she saw it was
a black goat with golden horns. Strangely
enough, as the light continued to fade, she
felt herself imagining that the goat was a
spirit, the spirit of that black goat sacrificed
on the highest mountain at midnight in the
dark of the moon. This, she knew, was pure
nonsense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>But why all this failing light? Was this
some trick? She was about to leap to her feet
and demand that the thing be stopped. Then
she thought of the ones who waited in the
room beyond the plastered wall. &ldquo;Nothing
serious can happen.&rdquo; She settled back.</p>
<p>But what was this? The room was now
almost completely dark. Along the far side
of the room she seemed to catch sight of
something moving. It rose and fell, like
some filmy shadow or trace of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a ghost!&rdquo; She shuddered. &ldquo;Yet it
is not white. It shines like ebony. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not really think the notion that
formed in her mind which was, &ldquo;This is
Cristophe&rsquo;s ghost, a black ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the thing moved slowly, oh so slowly
across the wall, there came the sound of
whispers&mdash;whispered words that could be
heard but not understood.</p>
<p>Florence was ready to flee. But what of
June? She must not leave her. This thing
was horrible. Yet it was fascinating.</p>
<p>And then, close beside her, there was a
movement. Looking down quickly, she
caught two golden gleams. &ldquo;The goat&rsquo;s
horns. He has moved, he is near me!&rdquo; She
was filled with fresh terror.</p>
<p>And then the light began returning. Slowly
as it had faded, so slowly did it return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Once again Florence looked at that spot
close by her side. The goat was not there.
Her eyes sought the opposite corner. There
lay the goat, apparently fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked the spirit of Cristophe.&rdquo; The
priestess spoke in her usual melodious drawl.
&ldquo;He says dere must be gold, much gold. A
statue to his memory must be built. There
must be gold, much gold. He will tell all
things&mdash;all&mdash;all things for gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now!&rdquo; she ended abruptly. &ldquo;Some
other time, you shall know all. There must
be gold, much gold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, for the second time, Florence
saw it, the shadow on the wall. It was the
same, the very same as that she had seen on
Madame Zaran&rsquo;s midnight blue drapes.
There was the sharp nose, the curved chin,
all that made up a perfect Satan&rsquo;s face. One
second it was there, the next it was gone.
But in that second Florence saw the large
black woman half rise as a look of surprise
not unmixed with fear overspread her face.
Then, as the shadow faded, she dropped
heavily back into the arms of the chair that
might have been a throne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>A bell tinkled. The brown girl appeared.
They were led out into the light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t even take my ten dollars,&rdquo;
June whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but she will in the end, and much,
very much more!&rdquo; These words were on the
tip of Florence&rsquo;s tongue, but she did not say
them. This surely was a strange world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June,&rdquo; said Florence after they had left
the home of the voodoo priestess&mdash;her voice
was low and serious&mdash;&ldquo;you must be very careful!
Such things as these might get you into
a great deal of trouble; yes, and real peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peril?&rdquo; The younger girl&rsquo;s voice trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;Most of
these fortune tellers, I&rsquo;m convinced, are rather
simple-minded people who earn a living
by telling people the things they want to
hear. They read your palm, study the bumps
on your head, tell you what the stars you
were born under mean to you, or gaze into a
crystal. After that they make you happy by
saying they see that you are to inherit money,
have new clothes, go on a journey, marry
a rich man and live happily ever after.&rdquo; Florence
laughed low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They charge you half a dollar,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;You go away happily and no real harm
is done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some of these people, I think&mdash;mind
you, I don&rsquo;t know for sure&mdash;some of them
may be sharpers, grafters in a big way. And
when a dishonest person is prevented from
reaping a rich but unearned reward, he is
likely to become truly dangerous. S&mdash;so,
watch your step!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she added after a time, &ldquo;your
problem may perhaps be solved in simpler
ways. Remember the suggestion of Frances
Ward? She said you should be able to recall
more than you have told thus far. If you
could remember the place where you lived
with your father, perhaps we could find that
place. Then, it is possible someone living
near there would remember your father.
That would help. In time perhaps we could
untangle the twisted skein that is your mysterious
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think we could?&rdquo; June&rsquo;s tone
was eager. &ldquo;But how can I remember a thing
I don&rsquo;t recall?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are people, great psychologists,
who have ways of making people think back,
back, back into the remotest corners of their
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know one of them?&rdquo; June asked
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at this moment, but I could find one,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone changed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to leave you here. I&mdash;I have an
appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was, in the end, to find a psychologist,
and that in the strangest possible manner.
Meanwhile, her appointment was with
Madame Zaran and her crystal ball. There
was just time to make it.</p>
<p>She arrived, rather out of breath, to find
the place much the same, yet somehow different.
The crystal ball was in its place at the
center of the room. The chair, the rug, the
midnight blue draperies were the same. Madame
Zaran came out with a smile to greet
her. All was as before, and yet&mdash;the big girl
shuddered&mdash;there seemed to be an air of hostility
about the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may gaze into the crystal.&rdquo; Madame&rsquo;s
claw-like hands folded and unfolded.
&ldquo;You may see much today. I have read it in
a book, the book of the stars. You were born
under a remarkable constellation. Yes, I do
horoscopes as well. But now you shall gaze
into the crystal ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew. Florence was left alone with
her thoughts and the crystal ball.</p>
<p>There followed a half hour&rsquo;s battle between
her thoughts and the magic ball. Her
thoughts won. No beautiful island came to
her in the ball, no stately trees, no still waters,
nothing. Only the sordid little world
which, it seemed, pressed in about her, stifling
all beauty, all romance, filled her mind. With
all her heart she wished that she was to fly
away with Sandy and Jeanne to the magic of
Isle Royale in winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will not go.&rdquo; She set her will hard.
&ldquo;I must not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there, standing before her, was
Madame Zaran.</p>
<p>There was a strange light in the fortune
teller&rsquo;s eyes. She said but one word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>In that one word Florence seemed to feel
a dark challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No vision today,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Madame&rsquo;s voice was harsh. &ldquo;And
there will be no visions for you. Never again.
You have betrayed the sacred symbol!&rdquo; Her
voice rose shrill and high. Her short fingers
formed themselves into claw-like curves. Her
tiger-like hair appeared to stand on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; her eyes burned fire. &ldquo;You are
a traitor. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off. Her weak mouth fell
open. Her pupils dilated, she stared at the
midnight blue drapes. Then, for a third
time, Florence saw it&mdash;the shadow, the long,
thin face, the narrow nose, the curved chin,
the shadow of Satan, all but the horns and
the forked tail.</p>
<p>While Madame still stared speechless,
Florence slipped from her chair, glided from
the room, caught the teetering elevator, then
found herself once more upon the noisy city
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;There was a time
when I thought this street a dangerous place.
Now it is a haven, a place of refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>She walked three blocks. Her blood cooled.
Her heart resumed its normal beat. She was
in a mood for thought. What did Madame
Zaran know? Did she know all? There had
been a little in her column that day, the column
&ldquo;Looking Into The Future,&rdquo; that was
about Madame Zaran&rsquo;s place and her methods.
No names were mentioned, no address
given. It was written only as an amusing incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course my name was not signed.
It never is,&rdquo; Florence thought to herself.
&ldquo;How could she know that I conduct that
column? And yet&mdash;&rdquo; Here truly was food
for thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; she said as, two hours later, they
sat reading beside a studio light, &ldquo;these fortune
tellers have an uncanny way of finding
out all about you. That black priestess today
told June all about herself. And yet, she
had never seen her before. Jeanne had made
an appointment over the phone, that was all.
I don&rsquo;t believe in black magic, though I did
see something very like a black ghost. But
how do they do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they do it?&rdquo; Jeanne echoed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a notion!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it out on one of the fortune tellers
of the simpler sort, you and I. What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything for a little happy adventure,&rdquo;
Jeanne laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, it&rsquo;s a go! We&rsquo;ll start it tomorrow.
And finish it, perhaps, the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I am intrigued!&rdquo; Jeanne threw
back her head to indulge a merry laugh.</p>
<p>Florence was glad that someone in the
world could laugh. As for herself, she felt
that things were getting rather too thick for
comfort. She felt that somehow she was approaching
an hour of testing, perhaps a crisis.
When would the testing come? Tomorrow?
Next day? In a week? A month? Who
could say? Meanwhile, she could but carry on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />FIRESIDE REFLECTIONS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune telling with cards,&rdquo; Jeanne
said thoughtfully after a time, &ldquo;is very
old. Madame Bihari told me all about it many,
many times. She truly believed that cards
could foretell your fate. Do you think she
was wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; Florence replied in a sober
tone. &ldquo;It is hard to know what to believe.
The whole thing seems impossible, and
yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many thousands who have believed,&rdquo;
Jeanne broke in. &ldquo;Many years ago
there was a very famous teller of fortunes.
He used seventy-eight cards. Those were
terrible times, the days of revolution. Men
were having their heads cut off because they
were called traitors. No one knew who would
be next to be suspected and led away to the
guillotine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Men used to come creeping to Ettella&rsquo;s
place in the middle of the night to ask if their
heads were to fall in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see it, Florence?&rdquo; Jeanne spread
out her arms in a dramatic gesture. &ldquo;A dimly
lighted room, a haggard face opposite one
who quietly shuffles the cards, invites the
haggard one to cut the cards, then shuffles
again. He spreads them out, one, two, three,
four. Nothing to laugh at, Florence&mdash;no joke!
It is life or death. Could the cards tell? Did
they tell? When the fortune teller whispered,
&lsquo;You shall live,&rsquo; or when he said hoarsely, &lsquo;Tomorrow
you shall die,&rsquo; did he always speak
the truth? Who can say? That was more
than a hundred and fifty years ago. But Florence,&rdquo;
Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes shone with a strange
light, &ldquo;even under those terrible circumstances,
men <i>did</i> believe. And they still believe
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence shook her shoulders as if
to waken herself from a bad dream. &ldquo;But&mdash;many
of them are frauds of the worst sort.
I can prove that. We&mdash;&rdquo; she sprang to her
feet. &ldquo;We shall try it tomorrow. This time
you shall have your fortune told. What do
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you may desire,&rdquo; Jeanne answered
quietly. &ldquo;Only let us hope it may be
a good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not matter,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s
rather strange reply, &ldquo;for in the end I feel certain
that I can prove the fortune teller to be a
cheat. And that,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;in spite of the
fact that I only know her name is Myrtle
Rand and that her &lsquo;studio,&rsquo; as she calls it,
is in the twenty-five hundred block on North
Clark Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have agreed to try this,&rdquo; said Jeanne,
&ldquo;but how will you prove that she is a fraud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see!&rdquo; Florence laughed. &ldquo;This
wonderful &lsquo;reading&rsquo; is going to cost you two
whole dollars. This is my prediction. But if
you feel it is not worth it, I shall make it up
to you out of my expense account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, it is done. Tomorrow my fortune
shall be told.&rdquo; Jeanne lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>It was Miss Mabee who broke in upon that
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;we must do
something for this beautiful boy musician you
found upon the roof! What is it he calls
himself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tum Morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must turn his tomorrow into today.
He is too splendid to be lost in the
drab life of those who never have a chance.
Let me see&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she exclaimed after a moment&rsquo;s
reflection. &ldquo;There is Tony Piccalo. He is
owner of that wonderful restaurant down
there in the theatre district. He is a patron
of art. He paid me well for two pictures of
west side Italian life. He has often urged me
to display my pictures at his restaurant. All
the rich people go there after a concert or a
show. I shall accept his offer. I shall display
all my gypsy pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled a wise smile.
&ldquo;We must have gypsy music and gypsy dancing
to go with the pictures. You, my Jeanne,
shall be the dancer and your Tum Morrow
the star musician. What could be sweeter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Tum is not a gypsy,&rdquo; Jeanne protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares for that?&rdquo; the artist laughed.
&ldquo;A few touches of red and brown on his
cheeks, a borrowed costume, and who shall
know the difference? If we bill him as a gypsy
boy, no one will insist upon him joining the
union. And who knows but on that night he
shall find some good angel with a good deal
of money. The angel will pay for his further
education. And there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Mabee,&rdquo; Jeanne protested, &ldquo;they
will become so absorbed in the show, they will
forget your pictures!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; She sprang to her feet as a sudden
inspiration seized her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make them
look, and we&rsquo;ll give them one grand shock!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it!&rdquo; Her manner became animated.
&ldquo;You paint a sketch upon a large square of
thin paper, then mount it in a frame. Set it
up with all your other pictures, only have it
close to the platform where I am to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; she laughed a merry laugh. &ldquo;I shall
entertain them with the wildest gypsy dance
ever seen upon the stage, and right in the
midst of it I shall leap high, appear to lose
my balance, and go crashing right through
that picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather fantastic,&rdquo; said Miss Mabee. &ldquo;I
agree with you in one particular, however. It
<i>will</i> give them a surprise. And that, in this
drab world, is what people are looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will do the picture?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very large one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very large one,&rdquo; Miss Mabee echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall have one very grand show!&rdquo;
Jeanne went rocketing across the floor in that
wildest of all gypsy dances.</p>
<p>Three days later the colorful sketch of gypsy
life, done on a large square of paper, was
finished and framed. It was a beautiful bit
of work. At a distance it could scarcely have
been told from a real masterpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you make it so beautiful? How
can I destroy it?&rdquo; Jeanne wailed at sight of it.</p>
<p>Well might some sprite have echoed, &ldquo;How
can she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture was to meet a stranger fate
than that, and to serve an unusual purpose
as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />JEANNE&rsquo;S FORTUNE</h2>
<p>Next morning it was arranged that
Jeanne should go unaccompanied to the
fortune teller on Clark Street. Florence would
be loitering on the street, not too far away.</p>
<p>Jeanne, as she started forth on this exciting
little journey, cut a real figure. She had
put on her finest silk dress. White gloves that
reached to her elbows were on her hands.
Her hat was from one of the best Michigan
Avenue shops. And, to make sure that she
would be taken for a &ldquo;little daughter of the
rich,&rdquo; she had borrowed the famous artist&rsquo;s
very best fur coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;it is wonderful to be
quite rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place on Clark Street surprised her a
little. A plain dwelling with ancient brownstone
front, it suggested nothing of the mysterious
or supernatural. Inside it was no
better. A sign read, &ldquo;Knock on the door.&rdquo;
The door in question was a glass door that
had been painted a solid brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Jeanne knocked timidly. The door opened
a crack, and a feminine voice said, &ldquo;Y-e-s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes that shone out from the narrow
opening registered surprise. Such a gorgeous
apparition as Jeanne presented in the borrowed
coat, apparently had seldom crossed
that threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy Burns, who sells rare stamps at
the Arcade, told me how wonderful you are,&rdquo;
Jeanne murmured wistfully.</p>
<p>This was a well-memorized speech. She
was at that moment recalling Florence&rsquo;s last
words before they parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fortune teller will not ask your name
or address. Don&rsquo;t give them to her. She <i>will</i>,
under one pretext or another, ask the name
and address of some person whom you know,
quite probably a rather humble person. However
that may be, give her my name and address.
Give her our telephone number, too,
and tell her I am always in between three and
four in the afternoon.&rdquo; Jeanne smiled in spite
of herself, recalling these words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>But the fortune teller was saying, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you come in, please? There now. Shall I take
your coat? You wanted a reading? Is that
not so? My very best readings are two dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne removed her coat and placed it upon
the back of the chair offered her. She produced
two crisp one-dollar bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The round face of the fortune teller
shone. &ldquo;You are to have a very wonderful
future, I can see that at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hope so.&rdquo; Jeanne appeared to falter.
&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; she leaned forward eagerly. &ldquo;I
have been&mdash;well, quite fortunate un&mdash;until
just lately. And now&mdash;&rdquo; her eyes dropped.
&ldquo;Now things are not so good! And I&mdash;you
know, I&rsquo;m worried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne <i>was</i> worried, all about that gorgeous
coat. She hoped Florence was near and perhaps
a policeman as well, but she need have
had no fear.</p>
<p>Florence was near, very near. Having
slipped through the outer door, she had found
a seat in the dimly lighted corridor. There
was a corner in the plastered wall just beyond
her. From behind this there floated
faint, childish whispers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>At last a face appeared, a slim pinched face
surrounded by a mass of uncombed hair. A
second face peeked out, then a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Florence beckoned. Like
birds drawn reluctantly forward by some
charm, the three unkempt children glided forward
until they stood beside her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Florence whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tillie,&rdquo; the largest girl whispered
back. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Fronie, and he&rsquo;s Dick. Our
mother&rsquo;s gone away. Myrtle takes care of
us, sort of like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re going to have ice cream and
cake for dinner!&rdquo; Fronie burst forth in a loud
whisper. &ldquo;The beautiful lady gave Myrtle
two whole dollars. We always have ice cream
and cake when Myrtle gets a dollar. This
time it&rsquo;s two.&rdquo; The child&rsquo;s pathetic face shone.</p>
<p class="tb">Within, Myrtle Rand, the fortune teller,
was saying to Jeanne:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may shuffle the cards. Now cut them
twice with your right hand. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;one, two, three, four, five, six; and
one, two, three, four, five, six. I see a change
in your life. I think you will go to California.
Yes, it is California. One, two, three, four,
five, six.&rdquo; She spread out a third row of cards,
then paused to study Jeanne&rsquo;s face intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair is beautifully done,&rdquo; she said in
a low tone. &ldquo;Who does it for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you mean you&rsquo;d like her address?&rdquo;
Jeanne started. How nearly Florence&rsquo;s words
were coming true!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes I would.&rdquo; There was eagerness
in the fortune teller&rsquo;s tone. Then, as if she
had been surprised into revealing too much,
she added, &ldquo;But then it does not matter too
much. You see I have a daughter who has a
very good position and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might like to try my hair-dresser,&rdquo;
Jeanne supplemented. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll write it
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the pencil proffered her she scribbled
down a name and address. The name was
Florence Huyler and the address that of their
studio. Then she smiled a puzzling smile.</p>
<p class="tb">Outside, Florence was saying to Tillie,
&ldquo;How do you know the beautiful lady has
given Myrtle two dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&mdash;we saw them through the
crack,&rdquo; Fronie sputtered. &ldquo;Two whole dollars!
Mostly it&rsquo;s only quarters and sometimes
dimes that Myrtle gets for telling &rsquo;em things.
Then we have bread that is dry and hard and
sometimes soup that is all smelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myrtle, she&rsquo;s good to us,&rdquo; the older child
confided. &ldquo;Good as she can be. But the rent
man comes every week and says, &lsquo;Pay, or out
you go!&rsquo; So all the quarters get gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a quarter Myrtle, she tells &rsquo;em their
husbands will come back next week, and some
day they&rsquo;ll have money, plenty of money.&rdquo;
The little girl leaned forward eagerly and
confidingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for two whole dollars&mdash;o-o-oh, my,
what a swell fortune! She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the outer door opened. A shabbily
dressed woman, carrying a bundle that
looked like a washing she was taking home
to be done, came in and dropped wearily into
a chair. Her eyes lighted for an instant with
hope as she stared at the closed door, then
faded.</p>
<p>The children vanished. A moment later a
second drab creature entered, and after that
a third.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All working women,&rdquo; Florence thought,
&ldquo;and all ready to part with a hard-earned
quarter that they may listen to rosy prophecies
about their future.&rdquo; She found her spirits
sinking. She hoped Jeanne&rsquo;s fortune would
be a short one.</p>
<p>It was not short. The cards were shuffled
three times. Then the crystal ball on the
table was gazed into. Jeanne&rsquo;s fortune grew
and grew. &ldquo;I see fine clothes and a big car
for you. You will go to California. Yes, yes,
I am sure of that. And money&mdash;much money.
You have rich relatives. Is it not so? And
they are quite old.&rdquo; Myrtle Rand went on
and on.</p>
<p>At last Jeanne said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I must go
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will return?&rdquo; Myrtle Rand&rsquo;s tone
was eager. &ldquo;There is much more to be told.
Very much more. Next time I will tell of
your past. I shall tell you many strange
things. It will surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne managed to slip from the room
without committing herself. A moment later
the poor woman with the large bundle took
her place before the crystal ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jeanne laughed low as she and
Florence walked into the bright light of day,
&ldquo;I have a very rosy future! I am to have all
that heart could desire&mdash;love, money, automobiles,
travel, everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next time you are going to be very
much surprised,&rdquo; Florence added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; Jeanne stared.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s true nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; Jeanne laughed afresh, &ldquo;you are
now my hair-dresser. You are to be at home
between three and four o&rsquo;clock tomorrow
afternoon. Why you made me tell that fib is
something I don&rsquo;t at all understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; Florence laughed merrily.
Then, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our car. Let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Next day Miss Mabee and Jeanne journeyed
to Maxwell Street in search of Bihari
and his gypsy blacksmith shop. Jeanne carried
a stool and folding easel, Miss Mabee
her box of beautiful colors and her brushes.</p>
<p>It was a lovely winter&rsquo;s day. Even the drab
shops of Maxwell Street seemed gay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Bihari&rsquo;s shop was not hard to find. Miss
Mabee fell in love with it at once. &ldquo;Long and
narrow. Plenty of light, but not too much.
The very place!&rdquo; was her joyous commendation.
&ldquo;And here are the women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was a group of women
patiently waiting to have their pots and pans
repaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the children?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>For answer Bihari stepped to the door, put
two fingers to his lips, blew a loud blast, and
behold, as if by magic the place swarmed with
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one. That one. This, and that one.&rdquo;
Miss Mabee selected her cast quickly.</p>
<p>Disappointed but not in the least rebellious,
the remainder of the band moved away. The
shop door was closed and work began.</p>
<p>Never had Jeanne experienced greater happiness
than now. To be the constant companion
of a famous artist&mdash;what more could one
ask? It was not so much that Marie Mabee
was famous. Jeanne was no mere hero-worshiper.
The thing that counted most was their
wonderful association. Somehow Jeanne felt
the power, the sense of skill that was Miss
Mabee&rsquo;s flowing in her own veins. And now
that she, for the time, was not the model, but
the onlooker, she experienced this sense of
fresh power to a far greater degree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>To sit in a remote corner of Bihari&rsquo;s long
narrow shop, to witness the skill with which
Miss Mabee assembled the cast for a great
picture, ah, that was something! To watch
her skilful fingers as by some strange magic
she placed a daub of color here, another there,
twisted her brush here and twirled it there,
sent it gliding here, gliding there, until, like
the slow coming of a glorious dawn, there
grew a picture showing Bihari, the powerful
gypsy blacksmith, the ragged gypsy children,
the anxious housewives, all in one group that
seemed to glorify toil. Ah, that was glory
indeed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Jeanne would never be a painter, she knew
this well enough. Yet she had sensed a great
fact, that all true art is alike, that a painter
draws inspiration and fresh power from a
great musician, that a novelist listens to a
symphony and goes home to write a better
book, that even a dancer does her part in the
world more skilfully because of her association
with a famous painter. So Jeanne basked
in the light that Miss Mabee spread about her
and was gloriously happy.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime Florence was keeping an
appointment on the telephone and, to all appearances
having a grand time of it. She was
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;yes, indeed!&mdash;Oh, yes, very rich.&mdash;And
old. Oh, quite old, perhaps eighty&mdash;Famous?&mdash;Oh,
surely, terribly famous.&mdash;Glorious
pictures. Yes&mdash;In Hollywood? She
hasn&rsquo;t told me for sure. But yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This went on for a full ten minutes. From
time to time she put a hand over the mouth-piece
while she indulged in peals of laughter.
Then, sobering, she would go on with her
conversation.</p>
<p>When the thing was all over, the receiver
hung up, she went into one more fit of laughter,
then said as she slowly walked across the
floor, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! I wonder how many of
them do it just that way? Perhaps all of
them, and just think how they can rake in the
money if they go after it in a big way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>A big way? Her face sobered. That beautiful
girl, June Travis, had met her once more
at the newspaper office. She had confided to
her that Madame Zaran had asked her for a
thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars!&rdquo; Florence had exclaimed.
&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell me where my father is.&rdquo; She
turned a puzzled face toward Florence. &ldquo;Why
not? If you were all alone in the world and
if you had even a great deal of money,
wouldn&rsquo;t you give it all just to get your
father back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps,&rdquo; Florence replied slowly, &ldquo;if
they really did bring him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they will!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed. &ldquo;They
will! Madame Zaran knows a truly great man
in the east. He has done wonderful things.
His fees are high. But great lawyers, great
surgeons ask large fees too. So,&rdquo; she sighed,
&ldquo;if my father is not found before I get my
money, I shall pay them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and perhaps much more,&rdquo; Florence
thought with an inward groan. &ldquo;But her
father shall be found. He must be, and that
in natural ways. He really must!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; Her spirits drooped. How?
Truly that was the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>A key in the door startled her from her
troubled thoughts. It was Jeanne back from
Maxwell Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find that thieving gypsy?&rdquo; Florence
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we did a glorious sketch of Bihari
in his shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the poor widow? She can&rsquo;t
eat your pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no.&rdquo; Jeanne put on a sad face. &ldquo;I shall
find her for you, though! Perhaps tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; said Florence with a lightning-like
change to a lighter mood, &ldquo;you shall
go to that place on North Clark Street and
have your past as well as your future told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added with a chuckle, &ldquo;lest you
be too much surprised by your fortune, I will
say this much: Myrtle Rand will tell you that
you have a grandfather who is very old and
very rich&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Florence, I have no grandfather. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence held up a hand for silence. &ldquo;As
for yourself, she will tell you that you have
been a gay deceiver, that you are a truly
famous young artist, a painter of landscapes,
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But how can I help that?
This is to be your past and future. If you
don&rsquo;t like the future, you may ask her to
change it. But what is done is done! You
can&rsquo;t change your past!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for your future,&rdquo; she went on, grinning
broadly, &ldquo;you are to journey to Hollywood.
There you shall be employed by a great
moving picture company simply to plan magnificent
backgrounds against which the
world&rsquo;s greatest moving picture dramas are
to be played.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Jeanne was so dazed that she
had no further questions to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only tomorrow will tell,&rdquo; she sighed as
she sank into a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />A STARTLING REVELATION</h2>
<p>And tomorrow did tell. Scarcely had
Jeanne paid her two dollars to the fortune
teller, Myrtle Rand, than the fortune
Florence had promised her began unfolding
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cards say this&mdash;&rdquo; Myrtle Rand shuffled
and dealt, shuffled and dealt again. &ldquo;I
see this and this and this in the crystal ball.&rdquo;
Nothing of importance was changed. Jeanne
had heard it all before. Florence had told
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could she know that the fortune
teller would say all this?&rdquo; she kept asking
herself. &ldquo;And almost all of it untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still asking herself this question
when she joined Florence for lunch two hours
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you know?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very simple,&rdquo; Florence replied in high
glee. &ldquo;I told her all that over the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Jeanne stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Florence replied, &ldquo;I was
testing her system which, after all, is a very
simple one. The first time you visited her she,
on a very simple pretext, got the name and
address of someone who knows you. On still
another pretext she called me on the phone
to ask about you, thinking me your hair-dresser,
and I told her things that were entirely
untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they had been true,&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed,
&ldquo;if I had known nothing of the phone
call, how astonished I should have been to
find that she could get so much of my past
from the cards and the crystal ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. And, quite naturally, you
would have had great faith in her prophecies
for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; Jeanne cried, &ldquo;she is a fraud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;But not a very
great fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie, Fronie and Dick will have ice cream
and cake for dinner,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; Jeanne asked in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are three foundlings that Myrtle
Rand is befriending. So-o,&rdquo; Florence ended
slowly, &ldquo;I shall not write up Myrtle Rand, at
least not with her real name and address. I
shall, however, make a good story of our
grand discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she added abruptly, &ldquo;brings
me to another subject. Sandy is flying north
tomorrow to witness the moose trapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. You may as well hurry home and
pack your bag. As for me, that may spell defeat.
I&rsquo;ll have to write my own stories, and
if I fail&mdash;&rdquo; She did not finish, but the look
on her face was a sober one. She had come
to love her strange task. She had planned
some things that to her seemed quite important.
She must not fail.</p>
<p>That evening at ten they sat once more before
the fire, Florence, Jeanne and Miss Mabee.
Because Jeanne was to go flying away
through the clouds next morning, they were
in a mellow mood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Marie Mabee rested easily in her deeply
cushioned chair before the fire. She was
wrapped in a dressing gown of gorgeous hue,
a bright red, trimmed in deepest blue. Upon
the sleeves was some strange Oriental design.
On her feet, stretched out carelessly before
the fire, were low shoes of shark skin, red like
the gown. With her sleek black hair combed
straight back from the high forehead, with
her deep dark eyes shining and her unique
profile half hidden by shadows, she seemed
to Florence some strange princess just arrived
from India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; Marie Mabee spoke at last,
&ldquo;what is it we ask of life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace. Happiness. Beauty,&rdquo; Jeanne spoke
up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success. Power,&rdquo; Florence added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace&mdash;&rdquo; Marie Mabee&rsquo;s tone was mellow.
&ldquo;Ah, yes, how many there are who seek real
peace and never find it! I wonder if we have
it, you and you and I.&rdquo; She spread her long
slender hands out before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; She laughed a laugh that
was like the low call of birds at sunset. &ldquo;Is
this not peace? We are here before the fire.
No one wishes to do us harm, or at least they
cannot reach us. We have food, shelter and a
modest share of life&rsquo;s beautiful things. Do
we not have peace? Ah, yes. But if not, then
it is our own fault.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The mind has its own place, and of itself
can make a heaven of hell, or a hell of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But beauty?&rdquo; Her tone changed. She sat
bolt upright. &ldquo;Yes, we want beauty.&rdquo; Her
eyes swept the room. There were elaborate
draperies, a tiny clock of solid gold, an ivory
falcon, an exquisite bust of pure white marble,
all the works of art she had gathered
about her, and above them all, one great masterpiece,
&ldquo;Sheep on the Hillside.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
agreed, &ldquo;we have a craving for beauty. All
have that perhaps. Some much more than
others. But beauty&mdash;&rdquo; she sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;Beauty, yes! Yes, we must have beauty first,
last and always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she began marching slowly back and
forth before the fire, Florence was shocked
by the thought that she resembled a sleek
black leopard. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she whispered to
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happiness? Yes.&rdquo; Marie Mabee dropped
back to her place of repose. &ldquo;Happiness may
be had by all. The simplest people are happiest
because their wants are few. Or are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Jeanne nor Florence knew the answer.
Who does?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But success,&rdquo; Florence insisted. &ldquo;Yes, and
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success?&rdquo; There was a musing quality in
Marie Mabee&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I wonder if success is
what I am always striving for? Or do I make
pictures because I enjoy creating beauty?</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all&mdash;&rdquo; she flung her arms wide.
&ldquo;What does it matter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But power!&rdquo; Her tone changed. &ldquo;No! No!
I have no desire for power. Leave that to the
rich man, to the rulers, anyone who desires it.
I have no use for power. Give me peace,
beauty, happiness, and, if you insist, success,
and I will do without all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, for a long time there was silence
in the room. Florence studied the faces of her
companions, each beautiful in its own way,
she wondered if they were thinking or only
dreaming.</p>
<p>For herself, she was soon lost in deep
thought. To her mind had come a picture of
Frances Ward. Her littered desk, her tumbled
hair, her bright eager eyes, the slow
procession of unfortunate and unhappy ones
that passed all day long before that desk of
hers&mdash;all stood out in bold relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does Frances Ward want?&rdquo; she
asked herself. &ldquo;Peace ... beauty ... happiness
... success?&rdquo; She wondered.</p>
<p>Here were two people, Marie Mabee and
Frances Ward. How strangely different they
were! And yet, what wonderful friends they
had both been to her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is strange. Perhaps
there was a time when Frances Ward
too wanted peace, beauty, happiness, success
for herself, just as Miss Mabee does. But now
she desires happiness for others&mdash;that and
that alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I too shall want
only that when I am old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, that disquieting &ldquo;And yet&mdash;.&rdquo; She was
wondering in her own way what the world
would be like if everyone sought first the
happiness of others.</p>
<p>Upon her thoughts there broke the suddenly
spoken words of Marie Mabee, &ldquo;Let us
have beauty. By all means! Beauty first, last
and always!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Two hours later Florence sat alone in the
half darkness that enshrouded the studio. The
others had retired for the night. She was still
engaged in the business of putting her
thoughts to bed.</p>
<p>It was a strange little world she found herself
in at this time. Having started out, with
an amused smile, to discover novel and interesting
newspaper stories about people who
pretended to understand other men&rsquo;s minds,
who read their bumps, studied the stars under
which they were born, psychoanalyzed their
minds, told their fortunes and all the rest,
she found herself delving deeper, ever deeper
into the mysteries of their strange cults. Ever
striving to divide the true from the false,
tracking down, as best she could, those who
were frauds and robbers, she had at last got
herself into a difficult if not dangerous situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that gypsy woman who stole from
a poor widow,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Jeanne&rsquo;s going
away. That cannot wait. I&rsquo;ll have to find
that gypsy. And then&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Then there was June Travis and her lost
father. Madame Zaran was on her trail; the
voodoo priestess too. June had made one
more visit to the priestess. She was afraid
the girl had said too much. At any rate, she
was sure the priestess had demanded a large
fee for finding the lost father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> shall find him,&rdquo; the big girl said, springing
to her feet. &ldquo;I must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell upon a picture standing on a
low easel in the corner. It was the one done
on thin paper. &ldquo;That is for Tum Morrow&rsquo;s
party,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Well, Tum Morrow&rsquo;s
party will have to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne&rsquo;s going away will leave us lonely,&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;But who can blame her? Isle
Royale was beautiful in summer. What must
it be in winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time she stood there dreaming of
rushing waters, leaf-brown trails and sighing
spruce trees. Then she turned to make her
way slowly across the room, up the narrow
stairway and into her own small chamber.</p>
<p>One question remained to haunt her even
in her dreams. Were all fortune tellers like
Myrtle Rand? Did they secure their facts in
an underhanded manner, then pass them on
to you as great surprises? Who could answer
this? Surely not Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />FIRE DESTROYS ALL</h2>
<p>A great wave of loneliness swept over
Florence as on the morrow&rsquo;s chilly dawn
she bade good-bye to her beloved boon companion
and to Sandy, then saw them mount
the steps of their plane and watched that
plane soar away into the blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isle Royale is hundreds of miles away,&rdquo;
she thought to herself. &ldquo;They will be back,
I&rsquo;m sure enough of that. Airplanes are safe
enough. But when shall I see them again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not loneliness alone that depressed
her. She was experiencing a feeling of dread.
She had dug deeper into the lives and ways
of some fortune tellers than they could have
wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are wolves,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;and
wolves are cowards. They fight as cowards
fight, in the dark.&rdquo; She told them off on her
fingers: the dark-faced gypsy woman was
one, Madame Zaran a second, Marianna Cristophe,
the voodoo priestess, a third. And
there were others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I am alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone? No! Her spirits rose. There was
still Frances Ward. &ldquo;Good old gray-haired
Frances Ward!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
grandmother. May God bless her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Frances Ward who helped her over
the first difficult hurdle of that day. Sandy
was gone. She must write her own stories.
This seemed easy enough, until she sat down
to the typewriter. Then, all thoughts left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, try a pencil,&rdquo; Frances Ward suggested
after a time. &ldquo;A pencil becomes almost
human after you have used it long enough; a
typewriter never. And why don&rsquo;t you write
the story of your little lost girl, June Travis?
Use no names, but tell it so well that someone
who knew her father will come to her aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo; Florence was endowed with fresh
hope.</p>
<p>With four large yellow pencils before her,
she began to write. The first pencil broke.
She threw it at the wall. The second broke.
She threw it after the first. Then thoughts
and pencils began flowing evenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>When, an hour later, Florence presented a
typewritten copy of the story for Mrs. Ward&rsquo;s
inspection she pronounced it, &ldquo;Capital! The
best that has been in your column so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be that this extravagant praise
turned the girl&rsquo;s head, leading her to commit
an act that brought her into great peril. However
that may be, at eight o&rsquo;clock that night
she fell into a trap.</p>
<p>The thing seemed safe enough. True, Florence
did the greater part of investigating in
the day time. But a &ldquo;spiritual adviser&rdquo;&mdash;who
would expect any sort of danger from
such a person?</p>
<p>That was what Professor Alcapar styled
himself, &ldquo;Spiritual Adviser.&rdquo; Had his sign
hung from a church, Florence would not
have given it a second thought. But the card
that fell into her hand said his studio was on
one of the upper floors of a great office building.
Perhaps this should have warned her,
but it did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take the elevator up there and ask
a question or two,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Might
get a grand story for tomorrow.&rdquo; She did,
but she was not to write it&mdash;at least, not yet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>There was no glass in the door of Professor
Alcapar&rsquo;s studio. A light shone through the
crack at the edge of the door. She knocked,
almost timidly. The door was opened at once.
She stepped inside. The door closed itself.
She was there.</p>
<p>Save for one small light in a remote corner,
the room was shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More of their usual stuff,&rdquo; she thought to
herself without fear. &ldquo;Darkness stands for
secrecy, mystery. At least, these people know
how to impress their clients. Spiritual adviser,
clothed in darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She became conscious of someone near her.
Then of a sudden she caught the distinct click
of a lock, and after that came a flood of light.</p>
<p>She took two backward steps, then stood
quite still. With a single sweep of her practiced
eye, she took in all within the room.
She started as her eyes fell upon&mdash;of all persons!&mdash;Madame
Zaran. She was seated in a
chair, smiling a complacent and knowing
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>The person nearest to Florence was a small
dark man with beady eyes. Farther away,
with his back to the door, was a powerfully
built, swarthy man whose broad neck was
covered with bristles.</p>
<p>More interesting than these, and at once
more terrifying, was a second small man. He
was working at a narrow bench. He wore
dark goggles. In his hand he held a sort of
torch. The light from this torch, when he
switched it on, was blinding. With it he appeared
to be engaged in joining certain bits
of metal. There was, however, on his face a
look altogether terrifying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trapped!&rdquo; the girl thought to herself.
&ldquo;Ten stories up. And it is night. Why
did I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to see Professor Alcapar?&rdquo; a
voice asked. It was the little dark man who
stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;&rdquo; the words stuck in her throat.
&ldquo;They have locked the door!&rdquo; she was thinking
a trifle wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Professor Alcapar,&rdquo; said the little
man in a perfectly professional tone. &ldquo;Perhaps
these good people will excuse me. What
can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;&rdquo; again the girl&rsquo;s voice failed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Truly angry at herself, she was ready to
stamp the floor, when the smooth voice of
Madame Zaran said, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a
chair? You must have time to compose yourself.
The Professor, I am sure, can quiet your
mind. He is conscious of God. He makes others
conscious of divine power.&rdquo; The words
were spoken in an even tone. For all this,
there was in them a suggestion of malice that
sent a cold shiver coursing up the girl&rsquo;s spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been kind enough to visit our
other place of&mdash;of business,&rdquo; Madame Zaran
went on when Florence was seated. &ldquo;You see
us here in a more intimate circle. This is our&mdash;you
might say, our retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retreat. Ah, yes, very well said, our retreat,&rdquo;
the Professor echoed.</p>
<p>Florence allowed her eyes to wander. They
took in the window. At that moment a great
electric sign, some distance away, burst forth
with a brilliant red light. Across this flash of
light, running straight up and down, were
two dark lines. She noted this, but for the
moment gave it no serious thought. It was
of tremendous importance, for all that. A
simple fact, lightly observed but later recalled,
has more than once saved a life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to see the Professor,&rdquo; Madame
reminded her. There was an evil glint
in her eye. At the same time the torch in the
corner hissed, then flamed white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;well, you see,&rdquo; the girl explained
in a voice that was a trifle weak, &ldquo;I am interested
in religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of religion?&rdquo; Madame Zaran
smiled an evil smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor,&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;is the sole
representative of a religious order found only
in the hidden places of India. It is a very
secret order. They are mystic, and they worship
fire, <span class="sc">FIRE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She repeated that last word in a manner
that caused the big girl&rsquo;s cheek to blanch.
The torch in the corner went sput-sput-sput.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; said the Professor in a voice that
was extraordinarily deep for one so small,
&ldquo;Fire destroys all, <span class="sc">ALL</span>! All that I know, all
that <i>you</i> know may be destroyed by a single
breath of flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s throat was dry. To calm her
fluttering heart she gazed again at the window.
Once more the red light of that street
sign flared out. As before, two dark lines cut
across it, up and down. Then, like a flash, the
girl knew what those lines were. They ran
from the roof to the ground. She had noted
them in a dreamy sort of way as she entered
the building. Now they appeared to stand
out before her in bold relief.</p>
<p>Then there burst upon her startled ears a
sharp cry of anger. She looked quickly at
Madame&rsquo;s face. It was black as the western
sky before a storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not even listen!&rdquo; She was fairly
choking with anger as she fixed her burning
eyes on Florence. &ldquo;You did not come here
to seek spiritual advice. You came here as a
spy. A <i>spy</i>!&rdquo; Her breath failed her. But in
the corner the white-hot torch sputtered, and
to Florence&rsquo;s terrified vision, written on the
wall in letters of flame there appeared the
word, <span class="sc">SPY</span>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could burn those words upon one&rsquo;s
breast,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;With that torch he
could burn out one&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo; She gripped at
her breast to still the hard beating of her
heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you spy upon us?&rdquo; Madame was
speaking again. &ldquo;Is it because we are frauds?
Because we pretend to know that which we
do not know? What is that to you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it because we take money from those
who can well afford to give? Look you! We
are poor. We have no money. But we must
live, and live we will! Why not?&rdquo; She laughed
a hoarse laugh. &ldquo;Why not? And what is it
to you if we do live well at the expense of
those who are weak and foolish? You and
your paper! Bah!&rdquo; She arose with a threatening
gesture. As she took two steps forward
her hands became claws, her teeth the fangs
of a wild thing.</p>
<p>Florence sprang back in sudden terror.</p>
<p>But the woman before her tottered on her
feet. Her face turned a sickish purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; She gurgled in her throat. &ldquo;It
is not for me! Come, Beppo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man at the bench turned half about.
At the same time his torch glowed with a
more terrifying flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; the Professor mumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>But for Florence there was to be no fire.
She was half way across the room. Ten seconds
later she had thrown up the window and
was standing on the ledge.</p>
<p>Caught by surprise, the others in the room
stood motionless, like puppets in a play. What
did they think&mdash;that she would dash her life
out on the pavement below? Or did they just
not think at all?</p>
<p>To Florence life had always seemed beautiful;
never so much so as at that moment.
To live, to dream, to hope, to struggle on and
on toward some unseen distant goal. Ah, yes,
life! Life! To feel the breath of morning on
your cheek, to face the rising sun, to throw
back your shoulders, to drink in deep breaths
of air, to whisper, &ldquo;God, I thank you for life!&rdquo;
This was Florence always. She would not
willingly dash out her own brains.</p>
<p>Nor was there the need. Before her, an
easy arm&rsquo;s length away, were two stout ropes.
The roof was undergoing repairs. Material
was drawn up on these ropes. They ended in
a large tub on the sidewalk ten stories below.</p>
<p>There was not a second to lose. The paralysis
inside that room would soon pass. And
then&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Her two strong arms shot out. She gripped
a rope. She swung out over space. Her feet
twisted about the rope. She shot downward.
There was a smell of scorching leather. Windows
passed her. In one room a char-woman
scrubbed a floor, in a second a belated worker
kissed his stenographer good-night, and then,
plump! she landed at the feet of a young man
who, up until that second, had been strolling
the street reading a book.</p>
<p>The young man leaped suddenly into the
air. The book came down with a loud slap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you do that sort of thing reg&mdash;regularly?&rdquo;
the young man stuttered when he
had regained a little of his dignity. He looked
up at the rope as if expecting to see a whole
bevy of girls, perhaps angels too, descending
on the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence laughed a trifle shakily, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t do it often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed,
&ldquo;you look all sort of white and shaky, as if
you&mdash;you&rsquo;d seen a ghost or something! How
about a good cup of java or&mdash;or something,
on a stool, you know&mdash;right around the corner?
Perfectly respectable, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As if I cared just now!&rdquo; Florence thought
to herself. &ldquo;Imagine being afraid of a young
student on a stool, after a thing like that!&rdquo;
She glanced up, then once more felt afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; She seemed to hear the Professor
say, &ldquo;Fire destroys all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Sure!&rdquo; She seized the astonished
young man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Sure. Let&rsquo;s go there.
Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />THE INTERPRETER OF DREAMS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Curiosity,&rdquo; said the young man as
he reached for the mustard, &ldquo;once
killed a cat. But anyway, I&rsquo;m curious. What
about it? Were you winning a bet when you
came down that rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had arrived safely at the little restaurant
round the corner. Perched on stools,
they were drinking coffee and munching away
at small pies for all the world like old pals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo; Florence hesitated. He was a
nice-appearing young man; his eyes were
fine. There was a perpetually perplexed look
on his face which said, &ldquo;Life surprises me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; she said, changing her mind,
&ldquo;perhaps I was winning a bet with&mdash;&rdquo; she
did not finish. She had started to say, &ldquo;a bet
with death.&rdquo; This, she reasoned, would lead
to questions and perhaps to the disclosing of
facts she wished to conceal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do beside reading books on
the street at night?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why, when I don&rsquo;t study books I study
people,&rdquo; he replied frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, you
might call me a psychologist, though that requires
quite a stretch of the imagination.&rdquo; He
grinned. Then as a sort of afterthought, he
added, &ldquo;Sometimes I tell people the meaning
of their dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, also!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, all
but dropping her pie. She began sliding from
the stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; he cried in sudden
consternation. &ldquo;What in the world have I
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you pretend to interpret
dreams. And there&rsquo;s nothing to it.
You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t look like a cheat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; he protested indignantly.
&ldquo;And there truly is something in dreams&mdash;a
whole lot, only not in the way people used to
think. Slide back up on that stool and I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiter,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;give Miss&mdash;what
was that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence for short,&rdquo; the girl smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Florence another piece of pie,&rdquo; he
finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; he launched into his subject
at once. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you what your dreams
are, then tell you &lsquo;You have dreamed of an
eagle; that is a good sign; you will advance,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;You dreamed of being married; that is
bad; you will become seriously ill, or shall
have bad news from afar.&rsquo; No, I don&rsquo;t say
that. All that is nonsense!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I do say is that dreams tell something
of your inner life. If they are carefully
studied, they may help you to a better understanding
of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting, if true.&rdquo; Florence took a
generous bit from her second small pie. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s all too deep for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo; The young student appeared
very much in earnest. &ldquo;Take this case: a
woman dreamed of seeing an elephant balancing
himself on a big balloon and sailing
through the sky. Suddenly the balloon blew
up, the elephant collapsed, and the woman
wakened from her dream. What caused that
dream?&rdquo; he asked, wrinkling his brow. &ldquo;The
woman had seen both elephants and balloons,
but not recently. Truth is, the balloon and
the elephant were symbols of other things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When a dream interpreter questioned her,
he found that she lived in a large, badly furnished
house which she hated. All but unconsciously
she had wished that the house would
collapse or blow up. The collapse of the elephant
symbolized the destruction of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And s-so,&rdquo; Florence drawled, &ldquo;she had the
old house blown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that wasn&rsquo;t the answer!&rdquo; the youthful
psychologist protested. &ldquo;The thing that needed
changing was her own mental attitude.
The way to fit our surroundings to our desires
is often to change rather than destroy
them. She had the house remodeled and refurnished.
And now,&rdquo; he added with a touch
of pride, &ldquo;she is happy. And all because of
the proper interpretation of her dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvelous!&rdquo; There was a mixed note of
mockery and enthusiasm in the girl&rsquo;s tone.
&ldquo;And now, here&rsquo;s one for you. I too dreamed
of an elephant&mdash;that was night before last. I
was in a jungle. The jungle seemed fairly familiar
to me. I was passing along a narrow
trail. There were other trails, but I seemed
to know my way. Yet I was afraid, terribly
afraid. The surprising thing was, I couldn&rsquo;t
see a living thing, not a bird, a bat, or even a
mouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; she drew a long breath.
&ldquo;Then in my dream I heard a terrible snorting
and crashing. And, right in my path
there appeared an immense elephant with
flaming eyes, eyes of fire. <i>Fire.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; She fairly gasped at the apparent
revelation of her own words. &ldquo;Fire destroys
all,&rdquo; she murmured low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; her new-found friend prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Florence laughed with a feeling
of relief. &ldquo;Then I woke up to find the sun
streaming in at my window. And, of course,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;it was that bright sun shining on
my face that caused the dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; said the student.
His tone was serious. &ldquo;I have a feeling
that you are in some sort of real danger. I
am surprised, now that I recall it, that I did
not see the elephant, or whatever he symbolized,
coming down that rope after you.
You&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t like to tell me?&rdquo; He hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;N-not now.&rdquo; Florence slid from her stool.
&ldquo;Perhaps some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K. Fine! I&rsquo;m greatly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;so am I.&rdquo; These words slipped unbidden
from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my card.&rdquo; He thrust a square of
pasteboard in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the pie!&rdquo; They were at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s more than all right. Remember&mdash;&rdquo;
his hand was on her arm for an instant.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, if you need me to interpret a
dream, or for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another piece of pie,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Just anything,&rdquo; he laughed back,
&ldquo;just give me a ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way!&rdquo; Florence said with sudden
impulse, &ldquo;there <i>is</i> something. Can you help
people recall, make them think back, back
into their past until they at last remember
something that may be of great help to
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it at times quite successfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d like to arrange something, perhaps
for tomorrow or the next day. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
give you a ring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone. Florence felt better. In this
great city she had found one more substantial
friend. In times like these friendships counted
for a great deal.</p>
<p>There come periods in all our lives when
life moves so swiftly that things which, perhaps,
should be done are left undone. It had
been so with Florence. As, a short time later,
she found time for repose in the studio under
the eaves of a skyscraper, she wondered if she
should not have called the police and had
that tenth story haunt of Madame Zaran and
the Professor raided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that&mdash;what?&rdquo; she asked herself.
To this question she found no answer. The
police might tell her she had been seized with
a plain case of jitters. Truth was, not a person
in that room had touched her. Madame
Zaran had indulged in a fit of passion&mdash;that
was about all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides&mdash;&rdquo; she settled back in her chair.
&ldquo;It is not yet time. There are things I want
to know. How was it that I saw real moving
figures in that crystal ball? How much of
Madame Zaran&rsquo;s work is pure show? How
much is real? I must know. And, meantime,
I must do what I can for June Travis.&rdquo; With
that she went away to the land of dreams.</p>

<br />THE SECRET OF LOST LAKE</h2>
<p>Jeanne toiled laboriously up the side of
Greenstone Ridge on Isle Royale. From
time to time she paused to regain her breath,
to drink in the cool clean winter air, and to
revel in the glorious contrasts of the white
that was snow and the dark green that was
spruce, fir and balsam.</p>
<p>She was on Isle Royale. More than once
she had been obliged to pinch herself to make
sure of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplanes are so sudden, so wonderful!&rdquo;
she had said to Sandy. &ldquo;Now we are in Chicago;
now we are in Duluth; and now we are
on Isle Royale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their trip north had been just like that, a
short whirring flight, and there they were
coming down upon Isle Royale. Landing on
skiis, they had taxied almost to the door of
the low fisherman&rsquo;s cabin which was to be
their temporary home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Here Sandy was to study wild life, find out
all he could about trapping wild moose and
send interesting stories out over the short-wave
radio. Here Jeanne was to wander at
will over the great white wilderness. And
this was exactly what she was doing now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a world!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;What a
glorious world God has given us!&rdquo; Her gaze
swept a magic wilderness.</p>
<p>Her heart leaped anew as she thought of
the chance circumstances that had brought
her to this &ldquo;Magic Isle&rdquo; sixty miles from the
Michigan mainland in winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to like Vivian,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;I am sure she is quite grand.&rdquo; She
paused a moment to consider. Vivian was
the fisherman&rsquo;s daughter. Her hands were
rough, her face was tanned brown. Her clothing
of coarse material was stoutly made to
stand many storms. Jeanne was dressed at
this moment in a sweater of bright red. It
was wool, soft as eiderdown. Her dark blue
knickers were of the latest cloth and pattern.
Miss Mabee had outfitted her in this lavish
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian and I shall be the finest friends in
all the world!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>With that, she squared her slender shoulders,
threw back her thick golden hair, drew
her wool cap down tight, then went struggling
toward her goal.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later a cry of pure joy
escaped her lips. &ldquo;How wonderful! How perfectly
gorgeous!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped. &ldquo;How
strange! They did not tell me there was a
lake on the other side, a gem of a lake hidden
away beneath the ridges. I&mdash;I doubt if they
knew. How little some people know about the
places near their own homes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give it a name!&rdquo; she cried, seized
by a sudden inspiration. &ldquo;It shall be called
&lsquo;Lost Lake.&rsquo; Lost Lake,&rdquo; she murmured. As
she looked down upon it, it seemed a mirror
set in a frame of darkest green.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hemlock turned to pitchy black</p>
<p class="t0">Against the whiteness at their back.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My Lost Lake,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I must
see it closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little did she dream that this simple decision
would result in mysteries and adventures
such as she had seldom before known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful it all is!&rdquo; she exclaimed
again, as at last her feet rested on the glistening
surface of the little lost lake.</p>
<p>She went shuffling across the dark, deeply
frozen surface. The first spell of severe
weather of that autumn had come with a
period of dead calm. All the small lakes of
the island had frozen over smooth as glass.
And now, though the ice was more than a
foot thick, it was possible while gliding across
it to catch sight of dull gray rocks and deep
yawning shadows where the water was deep.</p>
<p>Only the day before on Long Lake, which
was close to Vivian&rsquo;s home, Jeanne and her
friend had thrown themselves flat down on
the ice, shaded their eyes and peered into the
shadowy depth below. They had found it a
fascinating adventure into the great unknown.
In places, standing like a miniature
forest, tall, heavy-leafed pikeweeds greeted
their eyes. Among these, like giant dirigibles
moored to the tree-tops, long black pickerel
lay. Waving their fins gently to and fro, they
stared up with great round eyes. Here, too,
at times they saw whole schools of yellow
perch and wall-eyes. Once, too, they caught
sight of a scaly monster more than six feet
long. He was so huge and ugly, they shuddered
at sight of him. Vivian had decided he
must be a sturgeon and marveled at his presence
in these waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Recalling all this, Jeanne now slipped the
snowshoes from off her feet and, throwing
herself flat on the ice, began her own little
exploring expedition beneath the surface of
her own private lake.</p>
<p>She had just sighted a school of tiny perch
when a strange and apparently impossible
sight caught her gaze. Faint, but quite unmistakable,
there came to her mental vision
a circle of gold, and within that circle these
letters and figures: D.X.123.</p>
<p>One moment it was there. The next it was
blotted out by the passing of that school of
small fish. When the fish had passed, the
vision too was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it at all,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It
was just a picture flashed on the walls of my
memory&mdash;something I saw long ago. It is
like the markings on an airplane&mdash;the plane&rsquo;s
number. But it really wasn&rsquo;t there at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;That must be
the number on the airplane that carried us
here. I&rsquo;ll look and see when I get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She straightened up to look about her. As
she did so, she realized that the sun had gone
under a cloud. Disquieting thought, this may
have been the reason for the vanishing picture
in the depths below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fish hid it. Then the sun went under
that cloud. I must look again.&rdquo; She settled
down to await the passing of that cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I see it again?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Shall I tell the others? Will they believe me?
Probably not. Laugh at me, tell me I&rsquo;ve been
seeing things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; She came to a sudden
decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring Vivian up here and
have her look. I&rsquo;ll not tell her a thing, but
just have her look. Then if she sees it I&rsquo;ll
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sun was out from behind the cloud&mdash;time
to look again.</p>
<p>Her heart was beating painfully from excitement
as she shaded her eyes once more.</p>
<p>For a time she could make out nothing but
rocks and deep shadows. Then the school of
small fish circled back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to wait.&rdquo; She heaved a sigh almost
of relief.</p>
<p>But now something startled the perch.
They went scurrying away. And there, just
as it had been before, was the circle and that
mysterious sign: D.X.123.</p>
<p>Ten seconds more it lingered. Then, as
before, it vanished. Once again the bright
light had faded. This time a large cloud was
over the sun. It would take an hour, perhaps
two, for it to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go back,&rdquo; she sighed. Slipping on
her snowshoes, she turned about to make her
way laboriously up the ridge.</p>
<p>As she struggled on, climbing a rocky ridge
here, battling her way through a thick cluster
of balsams there, then out upon a level, barren
space, a strange feeling came over her, a
feeling she could not at all explain. It was as
if someone were trying to whisper into her
ear a startling and mysterious truth. She listened
in vain for the whisper. It did not come.
And yet, as she once more began the upward
climb it was with a feeling, almost a conviction,
that all she had done in the last few
days&mdash;the flight to Isle Royale, her hours
about the cabin stove, the climb up this ridge,
her discovery of Lost Lake and that mysterious
D.X.123&mdash;was somehow a part of that
which she had left behind with Florence in
Chicago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how it could be,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;yet somehow I feel this is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">That same evening in Miss Mabee&rsquo;s studio
an interesting experiment was in progress.
Made desperate by her terrifying experiences
in that tenth floor &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; of Madame Zaran
and Professor Alcapar, and quite convinced
that the beautiful June Travis was in great
danger, Florence had resolved to use every
possible means to discover the whereabouts
of June&rsquo;s father and bring him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone ten years!&rdquo; Doubt whispered to her,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead; he must be.&rdquo; Yet faith would not
allow her to believe this.</p>
<p>She had put herself in touch with June&rsquo;s
home and had secured permission to invite
her to the studio. When June arrived, she
found not only Florence, but the young psychologist,
Rodney Angel, and Tum Morrow.
Tum had his violin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The point is,&rdquo; the psychologist launched
at once into the business at hand, &ldquo;you, June
Travis, wish to find your father. If you can
recall some of your surroundings while you
were with him, we may be able to locate those
surroundings, and through them some friend
who may know at least which way he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said in a tone of perfect ease,
&ldquo;we are here together, four friends in this
beautiful studio. Our friend Tum is going to
give us some music. Do you like waltz time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adore it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waltz time,&rdquo; he nodded to Tum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he plays,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we shall sit
before the open fire, and that should remind
you of Christmas, stockings and all that. I&rsquo;m
going to ask you to think back as far as you
can, Christmas by Christmas. That should
not be hard. Perhaps last Christmas was a
glad one because all your friends were present,
the one before that sad because some
treasured one was gone. Think back, back,
back, and let us see if we cannot at last arrive
at the last one you spent with your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The look on June&rsquo;s face became animated.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try hard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not too hard. Just let your thoughts flow
back, like a stream. Now, Tum, the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For ten minutes there was no sound save
the sweet, melodious voice of Tum&rsquo;s violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; whispered the psychologist, &ldquo;think!
Last Christmas? Was it glad or sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one before that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went on back through the years
until with some hesitation the girl said once
more, &ldquo;Sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the psychologist asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted a doll. I had always had a new
doll for Christmas. The lady gave me no
doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who always gave you a doll at Christmas?&rdquo;
In the young psychologist&rsquo;s eye shone
a strange light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man, a short, jolly man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the last doll he gave you had golden
hair?&rdquo; He leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The hair was brown. The doll&rsquo;s eyes
opened and shut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you opened its eyes and said, &lsquo;See the
fire!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I took the doll to the window and
said, &lsquo;See the tower.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of tower?&rdquo; The air of the room
grew tense, yet the girl did not know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brownstone tower. A round tower with
a round flat roof of stone. There was a bell
in the tower that rang and rang on Christmas
Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you draw it?&rdquo; He pressed pencil
and paper into her hand. She made a crude
drawing, then held it up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Now, one more
question. What kind of a house was it you
lived in then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red brick house&mdash;square and a little
ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Wonderful!&rdquo; Rodney Angel relaxed.
&ldquo;I know that tower. There is only one
such in all Chicago-land. It was built before
the Civil War. It is a college tower. I doubt
if there is more than one red brick house
within sight of it. If there is not, then that is
where you lived. And if you lived there, we
will be able to find someone who knew that
short, stout, jolly man who was your father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; the girl cried, &ldquo;No! It can&rsquo;t
be! He is tall, slim and dignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that to be a fact?&rdquo; The
young man stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him in the crystal ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Rodney heaved a sigh of relief.
&ldquo;Well, perhaps your father is subject to
change without notice. We shall see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; he turned a smiling face to
Florence. &ldquo;How about another cup of coffee
and just another piece of pie, or perhaps two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think!&rdquo; June looked at the young psychologist
with unconcealed admiration. &ldquo;You
helped me do what I have never been able to
do before. You made me think back to those
days when I was with my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; Rodney said thoughtfully,
&ldquo;people will begin to understand the working
of their own minds. And what a grand day
that will be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; he smiled a bright
smile, &ldquo;if you girls have had any dreams you
don&rsquo;t quite understand, bring them to little
old Rodney. He&rsquo;ll do his best to unravel them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;how about the pie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />FROM OUT THE PAST</h2>
<p>In the meantime, Jeanne, having returned
from her little voyage of discovery on Isle
Royale, was learning something of life as it
went forward at Chippewa Harbor. Here, on
the shores of a little cove, Holgar Carlson, a
sturdy Scandinavian fisherman, had his home.
There were four children; two girls, Violet
and Vivian, about the same age as Jeanne,
and two small boys. From November until
April no boats visit the island. It would be
difficult to picture a more completely isolated
spot. And yet Violet and Vivian, who were
to be Jeanne&rsquo;s companions, were never lonesome.
They had their duties and their special
interests which kept them quite fully employed.
And, had they but known it, the coming
of Jeanne meant mystery and unusual
discoveries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo; Ah, yes, to Vivian, the younger
and more active of the two sisters, this
was one grand word. On this unusual island
she had made many a discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she was saying to Jeanne with the
air of one about to display rich treasures, &ldquo;is
our curiosity shop. Not everyone who comes
to Chippewa Harbor gets a peek in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After removing a heavy padlock she swung
wide a massive door of varnished logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained as Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes
wandered from one article to another displayed
on the shelves of the narrow room,
&ldquo;each article here has something to do with
the history of Isle Royale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only look!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;Arrowheads
and spear points of copper! A gun&mdash;such
an old looking one! A pistol, too, and
a brass cannon. Some very queer axes! Did
you find them all by yourself?&rdquo; she asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, no!&rdquo; Vivian laughed. &ldquo;They come
from all over the island. Fishermen are constantly
finding things. Some were found
where long lost villages have been, or around
deserted mines. Then, too, some were taken
up in nets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In nets?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice showed astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised!&rdquo; Vivian&rsquo;s face glowed.
She had something truly interesting to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We set our nets close to the lake bottom.
Sometimes the water is deep, sometimes shallow,
but always the net is on the bottom.
Storms come and bring things rolling in. The
waves work heavy objects over our nets. If
a net is strong enough, when it is lifted, up
they come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not so easily either!&rdquo; she amended.
&ldquo;Sometimes it takes a lot of pulling and hauling.
Not so fine when it&rsquo;s freezing on shore
and snow is blowing in your eyes. If you get
a log in your net, all water soaked, and so
long you never see both ends of it if you work
for an hour, then the net slips from your half-frozen
fingers, and it&rsquo;s just too bad! The net
is gone forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; She put a hand on some hard mass
that rested on the lower shelf. &ldquo;We brought
that up in our net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift it.&rdquo; Vivian smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Lightly Jeanne grasped it. Then she let
out a low exclamation. &ldquo;Whew! How heavy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty pounds,&rdquo; said Vivian, not without
a show of pride. &ldquo;Solid copper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she went on, allowing her eyes
to sweep the place, &ldquo;it is just this that has
made me realize that history and geography
are not just dull things to be studied and forgotten.
When father brought in that mass
of copper, I wanted to know all about it, how
it got there and all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find out everything,
because no one seems to know whether
it was put in its present form by the grinding
of glaciers or by the heat of a volcano. I did
find out a great deal, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she hurried on, &ldquo;one day while I
was hoeing in our garden I found this.&rdquo; She
held up a copper spear point. &ldquo;It belonged
to the time when Indians roamed the island,
building huge fires; then cracking away the
rocks, they uncovered copper. I read all I
could about that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; she caught her breath. &ldquo;Then
Mr. Tolman over at Rock Harbor gave me
this.&rdquo; She held up a curious sort of pistol.
&ldquo;They called it a pepper-box. It is more than a
hundred years old. Perhaps it belongs to fur-trading
days, perhaps to the beginning of the
white copper-hunter. Anyway, it took me
along in my study. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first thing you knew,&rdquo; Jeanne
laughed, &ldquo;history and geography had come
alive for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Vivian smiled her appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this? And where did it come from? Looks as
if it had been at the bottom of the sea for a
hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite a hundred years perhaps,&rdquo; Vivian
said slowly, &ldquo;and not at the bottom of
the ocean; only Lake Superior. It&rsquo;s an old-fashioned
barrel-churn, and we caught it in a
net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very strange!&rdquo; Jeanne examined it
closely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all screwed up tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Vivian, &ldquo;the fastenings are all
corroded. You couldn&rsquo;t open it without tearing
it up, I guess. It&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo; She tapped
it with the ancient pistol butt, and it gave
forth a hollow sound. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the use of
destroying a fine relic just to get a smell of
sour buttermilk fifty or more years old?&rdquo; She
laughed a merry laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you got it in a net at the bottom of
the lake?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s face wore a puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifty feet down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s full of air it would float,&rdquo; Jeanne
reasoned, &ldquo;so it can&rsquo;t be quite empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift it. Shake it,&rdquo; Vivian invited.</p>
<p>Jeanne complied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; she murmured
after shaking the small copper-bound
barrel-churn vigorously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heavy enough
to sink, yet it <i>does</i> appear to be empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne lay in her tiny chamber that
night with the distant roar of old Superior in
her ears, she found herself confronted with
two mysteries. One was intriguing, the other
rather startling and perhaps terrible. The first
was the mystery of the unopened churn, the
other that of those figures and letters with
a circle, D.X.123.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />D.X.123</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There it is. Or is it?&rdquo; Rodney Angel
turned enquiring eyes upon June Travis.
They had traveled by the third-rail line
twenty miles into the country. There before
them stood a large stone building topped by
a circular tower. Rodney held his breath. If
the girl said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; all this work had gone for
nothing.</p>
<p>June half closed her eyes. A dreamy expression
overspread her face. Once again she
was thinking back, back, back, into the dim,
misty realm of her childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said quite simply, &ldquo;yes, that is
the tower. I have seen it before. That must
have been when I was very young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; the word was said with a shout
of joy. &ldquo;Then right over there is the brick
house you once lived in with your father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our house!&rdquo; Who can describe the emotions
that throbbed through June&rsquo;s being as
she looked upon the home of her earliest
childhood?</p>
<p>She was not given long to dream. &ldquo;Come
on,&rdquo; said Rodney. &ldquo;There is a little cottage
next door to it. Looks as if it were half a
century old and been owned by the same person
all the time. That person should be able
to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That person&rdquo; turned out to be a little old
dried up man with a hooked nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know who lived in the red brick
house ten years ago?&rdquo; He grinned at Rodney.
&ldquo;Yes, and forty years ago. There was Joe
Green and Sam Hicks, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>ten</i> years ago!&rdquo; Rodney insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Now let me think. It was a&mdash;oh,
yes! That was John Travis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;J&mdash;John Travis!&rdquo; June stammered, fairly
overcome with joy. &ldquo;Oh, Rodney, you surely
are a wonder!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; There were tears in her eyes as
she turned to the old man. &ldquo;Please tell me
all about him! He&mdash;he is my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father? Yes, so he might be. There
was a small child and a woman, a little old
woman that wasn&rsquo;t his wife nor his mother&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t tell you much, miss,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;not a whole lot. He didn&rsquo;t live here long.
Wanderin&rsquo; sort, he was. A gold prospector,
he was. Made a heap of money at it. Short,
jolly sort of man, he was, short and jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Rodney reminded her, &ldquo;Your memory
was O. K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short and jolly&mdash;&rdquo; June murmured, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t understand. In the crystal ball&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little old man was talking again. &ldquo;He
seemed to like me, this John Travis. When
he went away in an airplane, he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplane!&rdquo; June breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, child! Didn&rsquo;t you know? He
went in an airplane. He invited me to the
airport. I saw him off. Just such a day as
this one, fine and clear, few white clouds
afloatin&rsquo;. I can see that plane sailin&rsquo; away.
Recollect the number of it even. It was D.X.123.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they say,&rdquo; he added slowly, &ldquo;that he
never came back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where was he going?&rdquo; June&rsquo;s voice
was husky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know. He never told
me that.&rdquo; The old man looked away at the
sky as if he would call that airplane back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he added after a time, &ldquo;is just
about all I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That too was all they found out from anyone
that day. The other people living close
to the red brick house were recent arrivals.
They knew nothing of John Travis.</p>
<p>When June, weary and sleepy from travel
and excitement, arrived at her home, she
found a telephone number in her letter box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence wants me to call,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Wonder if she&rsquo;s found out something important.
I&rsquo;ll have a cup of tea to get my nerves
right. Then I&rsquo;ll give her a ring.&rdquo;</p>

<br />ONE WILD DREAM</h2>
<p>Jeanne watched a blue and white airplane
soar aloft over a lake of pure blue.
Now the plane was two miles away, now one
mile, and now&mdash;now it was right over her
head. But what was this? A tiny speck appeared
beneath the airplane. It grew and
grew. Now it was the size of a walnut, now a
baseball, now a toy balloon, now&mdash;but now it
was right over her head! It had fallen from
the plane. It was big, big as a small barrel. It
would crush her!</p>
<p>But no! She would catch it. She put out
her hands and caught it easily as she might
have a real toy balloon.</p>
<p>She looked at it closely. It was a barrel-like
affair, an ancient churn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not heavy at all,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>But what was this? She was sinking, going
down, down, down. She was in the lake,
sinking, sinking. But that did not appear to
matter. She could breathe easily. The churn
was still in her hands when she reached bottom.</p>
<p>Fishes came to stare at her and at the
churn, friendly fishes they appeared to be.
They stood away and stared.</p>
<p>But now they were gone, scooting away in
great fright. A scaly monster with big staring
eyes rushed at her. She screamed, made
one wild rush&mdash;then suddenly awoke to find
herself sitting up in bed. She had been dreaming.</p>
<p>But what bed was this&mdash;what place? For
one full moment she could not tell. It was all
so very strange! The ceiling was low. There
were two other narrow beds in the room. A
large black pipe ran through the center of the
room. The place was cold. She shuddered,
then drew the covers over her. Then, of a
sudden, she remembered. She was in a fisherman&rsquo;s
cottage on Isle Royale in Lake Superior.
She had come there by airplane with
Sandy, who was to watch men trap wild
moose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Her real airplane ride was to be a long remembered
adventure. To go sailing over
miles and miles of dark blue waters, then to
catch sight of something very white that
really was an island but which, at a distance,
looked like a white frosted cake resting on a
dark blue tablecloth&mdash;oh, that had given her
a real thrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that was no dream,&rdquo; she assured herself,
&ldquo;for here are my two good friends, Vivian
and Violet Carlson, sleeping close by me in
their own beds. And that,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;is
why I dreamed of an airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But was it? And what of the barrel-churn?
The churn&mdash;ah, yes, she remembered now.
Vivian had shown it to her in her curiosity
shop. It was closed tight, all rusted shut,
and it had been picked up from the bottom of
the lake in a fisherman&rsquo;s net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s heavy,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to know what&rsquo;s inside it, if anything at all.
I&rsquo;ll find out, too. You can make things unscrew,
even if they&rsquo;re terribly rusted, by putting
kerosene on them. I&rsquo;ve seen father do
that. I&rsquo;ll ask Vivian if I may try to do it,
perhaps tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>For a moment, lying there listening to the
crackling of the fire in the stove below their
room, she felt all comfortable and happy. She
was in a strange little world, a fisherman&rsquo;s
world on Isle Royale. Everything was new
and lovely. There were sleds and snowshoes,
wild moose to trap, everything.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden her brow wrinkled. She
had recalled the airplane in that dream. What
did it mean? Then, as in a vision, she saw a
circle, and inside the circle D.X.123.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it at the bottom of that little lost
lake,&rdquo; she told herself as a chill ran up her
spine. &ldquo;Anyway, I thought I saw it. And I
must know!&rdquo; She clenched her hands hard.
&ldquo;I must know for sure! I&rsquo;ll just <i>make</i> Vivian
come there with me. I&rsquo;ll tell her to look down
there, ask her to tell me what she sees, then
I&rsquo;ll know for sure whether it is real or only
a sort of day-dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;must&mdash;must&mdash;must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again she was lost to the world, this
time to a land of dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>When she awoke, Vivian was sitting up
in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there!&rdquo; was Vivian&rsquo;s cheery greeting.
&ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Jeanne laughed. &ldquo;Everything seems
strange, but I love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite like a city,&rdquo; Vivian agreed, &ldquo;but
we all like it. We seem so secure. Father
earns enough in summer to buy flour, sugar,
hams, bacon and lots of canned stuff, so
we won&rsquo;t go hungry. The lake brings us some
wood and the ridges give us plenty more. We
won&rsquo;t get cold. So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re safe as a meadow mouse in his
hole!&rdquo; Jeanne said happily.</p>
<p>A half hour later she was seated at a long
table pouring syrup on steaming pancakes.
A sturdy, bronze-faced young man sat at
her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the moose-trapper?&rdquo; she asked
timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s hearty laugh
reassured her. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what you might
call me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to see one trapped?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo; Jeanne cried
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You and Vivian come along
with me after breakfast. We&rsquo;ve baited the
trap with some very tempting birch twigs.
We&rsquo;ll watch it from the ridge above. I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we&rsquo;d get one. Anyway,
you&rsquo;ll see the trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Donning mackinaws and heavy sweaters a
half hour later, they crept out into the frosty
air of morning&mdash;Jeanne, Vivian, Sandy MacQueen,
and the moose-trapper.</p>
<p>Snow lay thick everywhere. About the ends
of ridges it had been blown clear, only to be
found piled in drifts not far away. In quiet
spots it was soft and deep. Only the use of
snowshoes made travel possible. In silence
they marched single file up the rise at the
back of the house, then through a forest of
spruce and birch to the barren rocky ridge
above.</p>
<p>From this vantage point they could see far
out over the dark endless waters of Lake Superior.
But this did not interest them. Their
eyes were focused on a narrow stretch of low
growing timber almost directly beneath them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see the corral fence for the
trees,&rdquo; the moose-trapper explained in a whisper.
&ldquo;Only here and there you catch a glimpse
of it. We built a four-foot fence of woven
wire at first. But the moose,&rdquo; he chuckled,
&ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t know it was a fence, so they
lifted their long legs and hopped over the top
of it. After that we put poles above the wire.
That worked better. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Jeanne broke in. &ldquo;What was
that?&rdquo; Her keen ears had caught some sound
from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be a moose,&rdquo; Vivian whispered. &ldquo;It
<i>is</i> a moose. Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne started back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t harm you,&rdquo; Vivian whispered.</p>
<p>The moose, not a stone&rsquo;s throw away, was
trying in vain to reach the lowest branch of a
balsam tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How huge he is! And such terrible antlers!&rdquo;
Jeanne crowded close to her companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be losing those antlers soon,&rdquo; Vivian
whispered back. &ldquo;They grow new ones every
year. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the moose, whose keen ear
had apparently detected a sound, made a
quick, silent move. Next instant he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he vanished like magic!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed.
&ldquo;And with never a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most silent creature in the world.&rdquo; The
moose-trapper&rsquo;s voice was low. &ldquo;And one of
the most harmless. It seems strange that anyone
should wish to kill such an attractive wild
thing. And yet, thousands pay large prices
for the privilege of shooting them! It&rsquo;s up to
the younger generations to be less cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls don&rsquo;t wish to kill wild things,&rdquo; said
Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Most of them seem to have
a high regard for the life of all creatures,&rdquo; the
moose-trapper agreed. &ldquo;They have their part
to do, though. They can teach the boys of
their own neighborhood and especially their
own brothers to be more humane. We&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed. The quality of his
whisper changed. &ldquo;Down there is the trap.
See that large square made of boards that
seem to hang in the air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne replied eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the door to the trap. The moose
springs the trap. You see there&rsquo;s a narrow
corral. It&rsquo;s half full of birch and balsam
boughs. The moose smells these. He is hungry.
He goes through the door, munches
away at the branches, at last pulls at one.
This drags at a string and down goes the
door. He&rsquo;s a prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But a <i>happy</i> prisoner,&rdquo; he hastened to add.
&ldquo;There are ten moose in the big corral. When
we got them they were little more than skin
and bones. Now they are getting fat. We
feed them well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is doubtful if Jeanne heard more than
half that was said. Her eyes were upon a
brown creature that moved slowly through
the thin forest below. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going toward
the trap&mdash;our moose,&rdquo; she was saying to herself.
&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s only fifty yards away. And
now he walks still faster. He&rsquo;s smelled the
bait in the trap. He&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen to those who are
trapped?&rdquo; she asked quite suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably be taken to a game sanctuary on
the mainland where there&rsquo;s plenty of moose
feed,&rdquo; the trapper said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered. &ldquo;Then I hope we
get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we might.&rdquo; The moose-trapper&rsquo;s
face shone with hope. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the finest
specimen we&rsquo;ve seen yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Moments passed, moments that were
packed with suspense. Now the great brown
creature stood sniffing at the entrance to the
trap. Now he advanced a step or two. Now
he thrust out his nose in a vain attempt to
reach a branch that was inside. Jeanne
laughed low. He surely cut a comical picture,
long legs, extended neck, bulging eyes.</p>
<p>Another step, two, three, four, five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s inside!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed.</p>
<p>Yes, the moose was inside. He was munching
twigs and small branches, yet nothing
happened. The suspense continued. Would
he satisfy his hunger and leave without
springing the trap? Jeanne studied the moose-trapper&rsquo;s
face. She read nothing there.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the moose, seeming to grow
impatient of his small twigs, reached far out
for a large balsam bough, and bang!&mdash;the
trap was sprung.</p>
<p>Startled, the moose sprang forward. Next
instant he was racing madly about the small
enclosure. Almost at once an opening appeared
and he dashed through it to disappear
from sight. &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Jeanne
exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only into the larger corral.&rdquo; The moose-trapper
chuckled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find a number of
old friends there. They will tell him they&rsquo;ve
found a good boarding place. Soon he will
be as happy as any of them. And say!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;What a grand big fellow he is! Jeanne,
I believe you have brought good luck with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hope so.&rdquo; Jeanne beamed.</p>
<p>That bright winter&rsquo;s day passed all too
soon. At times Jeanne thought of asking
Vivian to accompany her to the top of the
ridge and down to the little lost lake, but
always she was busy with household duties.
Night found the request lingering unexpressed
on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darkness fell on the wings of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamps were lit, kerosene lamps that gave
forth a steady yellow glow. Pulpwood logs,
gathered from the shore where they were
stranded, roared and crackled in the great
stove.</p>
<p>Jeanne sat dreaming by the fire. Not all
her dreams were happy ones. One thought
haunted her: she must take Vivian to that
little lost lake. What would she see? What
would she?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Jeanne was asking herself this question
when her thoughts were caught and held by a
conversation between the young airplane pilot
who had flown them to the island and Sandy
MacQueen, the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you could write a whole book
about mystery planes,&rdquo; the pilot suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery planes?&rdquo; Sandy sat up straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the pilot replied. &ldquo;Planes that have
flown away into the blue and just vanished.
There have been several, you know.&rdquo; His
tone was earnest. &ldquo;During the war there
were aces of the air that vanished. What happened?
Did they grow sick of the terror of
war and just fly away?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been several in recent years,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;One started for Central America,
the X.Z.43. Nothing was ever heard of it.
One headed for Japan, the B.L.92. And then
there was the D.X.123. Queer about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The D.X.123!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered the
words. She wanted to scream them. She
said nothing out loud, just sat there staring.
D.X.123! Those were the letters and figures
she had seen down at the bottom of the lost
lake. Or, <i>had</i> she seen them? Had she just
imagined them? Had she seen them in a
paper and was this only an after-image?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>She wanted to ask the pilot what happened
to the D.X.123. She could not. At last she
rose from her place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going for a little walk,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;All alone. I won&rsquo;t get lost. I&rsquo;ll watch the
light from the house. It will guide me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crisp night air was like ice on a hot
summer day to her burning cheeks. Her mind
was full of wild thoughts. How strange life
was!</p>
<p>Then she looked up at the heavens. The
stars were there, had been there since earliest
history of man, and long before that. Back of
the stars was God. And God was from everlasting
to everlasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God guide me aright!&rdquo; she prayed reverently.</p>
<p>So she wandered on and on over the trail
that ran up the ridge and led to a view of
the great Lake Superior. She wanted to see
the moon as it shone upon the dark waters of
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>She was not destined to have her wish.
Suddenly as she rounded that clump of spruce
trees, she heard a groan that sent a chill of
terror coursing up her spine.</p>
<p>Turning quickly about, she saw, not ten
paces behind her, the most gigantic moose
that had ever lived, or so it seemed to her.
His antlers were like broad flat beams and
his eyes, as she threw her flashlight&rsquo;s glow
upon them, shone like fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Go back! Go back!&rdquo;
But the giant moose came straight on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>

<br />SOME CONSIDERABLE TREASURE</h2>
<p>June Travis felt her hand tremble as
she took down the receiver to call Florence.
&ldquo;Whose hand would not tremble?&rdquo; she
asked herself. And indeed the events of the
past few days had been exciting. Now Florence
had left word to call her. &ldquo;Something
very important to talk about!&rdquo; That was her
message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hello!&rdquo; she heard. &ldquo;Yes, this is
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, June, the strangest things do happen!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;You remember that
little story I wrote about your lost father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, today while I was out, a little lady
in gray called at the office. Frances Ward
talked to her. And was she mysterious! Wanted
to talk to me, no one else. After that, she
said she would talk to you, or to both of us
at once. Had something tremendously important
to tell you. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s about your father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; June gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;&rdquo; the voice at the other end
of the line dropped. &ldquo;Of course, you must not
expect too much. She said something about
mind-reading, mental telepathy and all that.
She may be just one more fortune teller. But
somehow I can&rsquo;t help but feel that she isn&rsquo;t.
She lives in quite an exclusive section of the
city. Mrs. Ward says she wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed
to put out a sign in that section. And what&rsquo;s
a fortune teller without a sign? So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all excited!&rdquo; June thrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you mustn&rsquo;t be&mdash;at least not too
much. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ve got to go after something
else. Remember that gypsy fortune
teller who stole four hundred dollars? I&rsquo;ve
got to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t that be terribly dangerous?&rdquo;
June&rsquo;s voice wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger? What is danger?&rdquo; Florence
laughed. &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s part of my job. I
really haven&rsquo;t accomplished much yet. Been
drawing my pay all the time. Perhaps this
will be a scoop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>As you shall see, it was a &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; in more
ways than one.</p>
<p class="tb">If Florence was anticipating trouble,
Jeanne, on far-away Isle Royale, was in the
midst of it at that very moment.</p>
<p>Who can describe Jeanne&rsquo;s fright as she
turned about on the wintry trail to look into
the gleaming eyes of a giant moose? She expected
nothing less than a wild snorting
charge from the monster.</p>
<p>And where should she go? To swing about
and dash back over the trail was impossible.
The way was too narrow. To go forward
meant that she would come at last to the
brink of a rocky precipice. At the foot of this
precipice, piled up by an early winter storm,
were great jagged masses of ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; she screamed at the top of her
voice. &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the moose did not go back. Instead he
lowered his great antlers, took three steps
forward, then after opening his great mouth
and, allowing an apparently endless tongue
to roll about, he let forth a most terrific roar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>To say that Jeanne was frightened would
be not to express her feelings at all. She was
fairly paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>As if this were not enough, her startled
eyes caught some further movement in the
brush that grew to the right of the trail. As
her trembling fingers directed the light of her
torch there, a second smaller pair of eyes
gleamed at her, then another and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves&mdash;bush wolves!&rdquo; Her heart sank
to the depths of despair.</p>
<p>She raced forward in a mad hope of finding
foothold for descending the cliff that led down
to the lake&rsquo;s shore. She caught the magnificent
picture of dark waters white with racing
foam, a path of gold that was moonlight, and
beyond that, limitless night. Then a strange
thing happened. The giant moose, having
given vent to a second roar, took one more
step forward; then stumbling, fell upon his
knees.</p>
<p>Strangest of all, he did not rise at once.
Instead, as if the great weight of his towering
antlers were too much for him to bear,
he allowed his head to drop forward until his
broad nose rested on the ground. For one full
moment he remained thus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>As for Jeanne, she raced on to the edge of
the precipice. Instantly she shrank back.
Surely here was no way of escape. A sheer
drop of fifty feet, and beneath that, up-ended
fragments of ice standing like bayonets waiting
for one who might drop. This was what
met her gaze.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, in the midst of all this
terror, the glorious scene&mdash;limitless water,
golden moon and night, so gripped her that
for the instant her mind was filled with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God,&rdquo;
she murmured.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just this consciousness of
the nearness of God and the glory of His
world that quieted her soul and gave her the
power to see things as they truly were.</p>
<p>As she turned back from the precipice, she
saw the moose struggling to regain his feet.
&ldquo;Until he is up again, he is harmless,&rdquo; she
assured herself. Having thrown her light
full upon him, she cried out in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! The poor fellow! He is like a
walking skeleton! He must be starving!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Like a flash all was changed. Fear gave
way to pity and desire to aid. She recalled
the moose-trapper&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;We think they
are underfed&mdash;perhaps starving.&rdquo; Here was
one who had failed to find food. How could
she help him?</p>
<p>For a moment she could not think. Then it
came to her that the food in the moose-trap
was branches of white birch, mountain-ash
and balsam. Close to the moose, who still
struggled vainly to rise, was a clump of birch
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are small, but the branches are too
high for him,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;If I cut down
the one that leans toward him, it will almost
touch him. If I do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. At her belt hung a small axe
in a sheath. Dared she use it? Could she take
the dozen steps toward that moose and wield
her axe upon that tree with a steady hand?
Her heart pounded painfully. Then, as if
whispered in her ear, there came to her, &ldquo;He
notes the sparrow&rsquo;s fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no further hesitation. Gripping
her axe, she advanced boldly. As she did so,
the moose gave vent to one more terrifying
roar. But Jeanne scarcely heard. She had
formed a purpose. It should be carried out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Her axe sounded
out in the silent night. Came a cracking
sound. The small tree swayed, then went
down. The top branches switched the great
beast&rsquo;s nose. He did not appear to mind, but,
reaching out, began eating greedily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jeanne breathed. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll do
one more for good measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second tree tottered to a fall; then, still
gripping her axe, Jeanne sped on the wings
of the wind toward the cabin where the lamp
still sent out its inviting gleam.</p>
<p>One sound gave speed to her swift feet.
The blood-curdling howl of a bush wolf was
answered by another and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix those wolves!&rdquo; Mr. Carlson exclaimed
as Jeanne, five minutes later, in excited
words told her story. Taking down his
rifle, he disappeared into the dark outside.
Shortly after there came the short quick
crack-crack-crack of a rifle. After that the
night was silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That moose,&rdquo; said Violet, the quiet, studious
sister of Vivian, who took an especial
pleasure in watching all manner of wild creatures,
&ldquo;must have been Old Black Joe. We
called him that,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;because he
was almost black, and because he was so old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How he does love apples!&rdquo; She laughed
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you fed him almost half a
bushel!&rdquo; said Vivian reprovingly. &ldquo;As if there
were apple trees on Isle Royale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to buy them,&rdquo; she explained to
Jeanne. &ldquo;Brought them all the way from
Houghton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think what I got out of it in the end!&rdquo;
Violet reminded her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Vivian agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Violet explained enthusiastically,
&ldquo;Old Black Joe got so tame after I had
fed him a peck of apples, one at a time, that
he&rsquo;d follow me about like a pet lamb. And
oh, the noises he&rsquo;d make way down in his
throat asking for more apples!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one day a man came here to get pictures
of wild life. Old Black Joe and I put
on a real show for him. I didn&rsquo;t quite ride
the old fellow&rsquo;s back, but I did almost. The
picture came out fine. When the man left he
gave me a whole twenty dollar bill for our
boat. Wasn&rsquo;t that grand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Depends on how good a boat it was,&rdquo; said
Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t the boat yet. We&rsquo;re saving
for it,&rdquo; said Violet.</p>
<p>Jeanne looked puzzled. &ldquo;I thought you sold
him a boat for twenty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Violet laughed merrily. &ldquo;He gave
that money to us so we could apply it
on the boat we are going to buy. But of
course,&rdquo; Violet paused. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand.
For quite a long time Vivian and I
have been saving up to buy a boat, a smart
little motor boat we can use for taking people
on picnics, fishing trips and cruising parties.
You saw the cabins at the foot of the hill.
Tourists come to the island and rent them in
summer. Vivian and I could help father out
with the family expenses if we had a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next year we want to go to high
school on the mainland,&rdquo; Vivian put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got nearly sixty dollars,&rdquo; Violet
concluded, &ldquo;but of course that&rsquo;s not nearly
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>For a moment there was silence in the
room. Then Violet said, &ldquo;If that really is Old
Black Joe, we must manage to get him into
the corral. There are a few apples left. I&rsquo;ll
just lead him right in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; drawled the moose-trapper, &ldquo;and
after he&rsquo;s in, you&rsquo;ll have to feed him. He&rsquo;s
so old he&rsquo;s almost sure to die on our hands.
What we&rsquo;re after is good live young moose
that will stand shipping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! All right, sir! We&rsquo;ll feed him!&rdquo;
the girls agreed as with one voice. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll
see. He&rsquo;ll be the prize picture of the big show
in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Jeanne did not go over Greenstone Ridge
and down to her Lost Lake next morning. It
was a day of wild storm. The wind whistled
and sang about the cabin. The spruce trees
swayed and sighed. The wind, like a white
sheet, rose and fell as it swept across the
frozen surface of the harbor.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the three girls hunted up
Old Black Joe. He had fallen asleep beneath
a cluster of cedars. Had the girls not found
him, this sleep might well have been his last.
As it was, only by eager coaxing and reluctant
flogging were they able at last to usher
him into the trap that was in truth a haven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Vivian exclaimed. &ldquo;Now we have
let ourselves in for a winter&rsquo;s work. That
moose-trapper does not like bringing in
boughs any too well. He&rsquo;ll surely hold us to
our bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure poor Old Black Joe needs a
friend,&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll pay us back, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; said the
sentimental Violet. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that line
about casting your bread on the waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cast our brush on the snow,&rdquo; Vivian
laughed, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s really all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were back at the cabin and well
thawed out, Jeanne found herself thinking
once more of the mysterious airplane,
D.X.123, that had vanished, and the strange
coincidence of her seeing those signs at the
bottom of Lost Lake. Soon she found herself
brooding over the possible discoveries she
might make in the very near future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; she told herself stoutly.
&ldquo;Surely dread has spoiled many a fine life,
and more often than not there is really nothing
to be feared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>To clear her mind of this dark shadow, she
began searching about for some bright dream
when, with a mental &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she sprang
to her feet. She had thought of the ancient
churn. &ldquo;Another mystery,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;and this will be a joyous one, I feel sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went in search of Vivian and, to her
vast astonishment, found her cooped up in a
tiny room heated by an oil stove. Over the
girl&rsquo;s head a pair of ear-phones were tightly
clamped. By the expression on her face,
Jeanne knew her to be so absorbed as to be
completely lost to the world.</p>
<p>For a full five minutes Jeanne stood patiently
waiting. Then, with a start, Vivian
looked her way. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.
&ldquo;There is a radio in the living room. Surely
you don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coop myself up in here to listen?&rdquo; Vivian
put in. &ldquo;No. But this is not just a receiving
radio. It is a radio station; short wave. We
are licensed to send messages free of charge.
And we <i>do</i> send them.&rdquo; Her eyes shone with
pride. &ldquo;We are the only station on the island.
We saved a boy&rsquo;s life by calling a doctor from
the mainland. We called for the coast guard
when a hydroplane crashed on Rock Harbor.
Oh, yes, and we&rsquo;ve done much more. But
now, I was about to get off a message telling
of the moose trap. You see, we&rsquo;re the radio
news reporter for this corner of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I disturbed you,&rdquo; Jeanne apologized.
&ldquo;It must be fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Vivian,&rdquo; she changed the subject, &ldquo;do
you mind if I look at the things in your museum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Here&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Vivian&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne hesitated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to try opening that old churn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever for?&rdquo; Vivian exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a feeling about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. But you won&rsquo;t break anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo; Jeanne took the key and
hurried away, little dreaming that the short
wave station she had just seen was to have
a large part in the mystery drama that was
to be played by the inhabitants of Chippewa
Harbor on Isle Royale, in the days that were
to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Armed with a bottle of kerosene and a small
knife, Jeanne slipped into the &ldquo;museum&rdquo; and
closed the door. It was a wintry spot, that
small room, but warmed by her enthusiasm,
she began her task without one shiver. Soon
she was scraping away at the corroded metal
clasps, applying kerosene, scraping again.</p>
<p>For a long time there was not the least sign
of success. She was all but ready to give up
when, as her stout young hands turned at one
screw it gave forth the faintest sort of squeak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you will!&rdquo; she breathed exultantly.
Then she redoubled her efforts.</p>
<p>At the end of another half hour that one
clamp was entirely loose. Three others remained.
Another half hour and, quite suddenly,
as if resistance were no longer possible,
two clamps loosened at once. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she
breathed. &ldquo;Now I have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true, for once three clamps were
loosed, the cover could be removed. Here she
paused. Though an only child, Jeanne had
never been selfish. She had always shared
her joys, whenever possible. She was about
to open a thing that had been closed for half
a century or more. What would she find?
&ldquo;A whiff of sour buttermilk,&rdquo; as Vivian had
prophesied? If more than this, what then?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A laugh or a secret is always better when
shared,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Opening the door, she called softly, &ldquo;Girls!
Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Vivian and Violet had entered she
closed the door. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said in the most
mysterious of tones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done like this. You
turn this screw, then that one. Now this one,
now that one, and, presto! It&rsquo;s open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true the churn smelled of sour buttermilk,
and such a sourness as it was! This
was not all, however. Wedged into the churn
so it could not possibly be shaken about was
some heavy object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s copper!&rdquo; Vivian exclaimed. &ldquo;A lump
of pure native copper taken from the rocks
here on the island. How strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered. &ldquo;Here, tucked
away in a crevice of the copper, is a bit of
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note! It&rsquo;s written on!&rdquo; Violet cried.</p>
<p>As Jeanne&rsquo;s trembling fingers unfolded it,
at the very center of a small page filled with
writing, her eyes caught three words that
stood out like mountain peaks. The words
were: <span class="sc">Some considerable treasure</span>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />BATTLE ROYAL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t people take care of their
money?&rdquo; It was on that same afternoon
that Florence found herself asking this
question. There was a scowl on her brow as
she journeyed slowly toward the home of
Margaret DeLane, the widow who had been
robbed by a gypsy fortune teller. &ldquo;Some people
are so stupid they don&rsquo;t deserve any help,&rdquo;
she was thinking as she studied the faces
about her on the street car. Stolid and stupid
they surely appeared to be. &ldquo;Not an attractive
face among them all. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off to stifle a groan. The woman
she sat next to was large. This had crowded
her half into the aisle. A second woman, in
passing, had stepped on her foot. Instead of
appearing sorry about it, the woman grinned
as if to say, &ldquo;Ha! Ha! Big joke!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Big joke!&rdquo; Florence thought grimly.
&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s a big joke, and the joke&rsquo;s always on
me.&rdquo; Life had not seemed so joyous since
Jeanne had gone away. It is surprising that
the absence of one person can mean so much
to us.</p>
<p>The street car came to a jerking halt. &ldquo;My
street.&rdquo; She was up and off the car.</p>
<p>Her street, and such a street as it was!
Narrow and dirty, its sidewalks were lined
with ugly, blank-faced, staring frame buildings
that appeared to shout insults at her.
She trudged on.</p>
<p>At last she came to the worst building of
them all, and there on the front was her
number.</p>
<p>Following instructions, she came at last
to a side door. Having knocked, she was admitted
at once by a dark-haired girl. This
girl, who might have been twelve, wore an
apron pinned about her neck. The apron
touched the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mrs. DeLane live here?&rdquo; Florence
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my mother, and I am Jane,&rdquo;
said the girl. &ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t here. She&rsquo;s out
scrubbing. She&rsquo;ll be back very soon. Won&rsquo;t
you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>The child was so polite, the place was so
neat and clean, that Florence felt as though
the sun had suddenly burst through a cloud.</p>
<p>Two younger children were playing at keeping
house in a corner. How beautiful and
bright they were! Their eyes, their hair, even
their simple cotton garments fairly shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; thought Florence, swallowing
hard, &ldquo;is what Margaret DeLane lives for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly her spirits rose. &ldquo;Why, this
is what we all live for, the little children!&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;We all at times are foolish. Many
of us break the law. Few of us who are older
deserve a great deal of sympathy. It&rsquo;s the
children, poor little innocent ones, who are
too young to do any wrong&mdash;they are the
ones who suffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they must not!&rdquo; she thought with sudden
fierceness. &ldquo;They must not. We must
find that gypsy robber and get that money
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to this fierce resolve, the
door opened and in walked Margaret DeLane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was that I wanted to do so much!&rdquo;
the woman all but sobbed as she told her
story. &ldquo;Mrs. Doyle, two doors away, asked
a fortune teller how she should invest her
money. She said, &lsquo;Buy a house.&rsquo; Mrs. Doyle
bought a house, one of the worst in the city.
Someone wanted the land for what they
called &lsquo;slum clearance,&rsquo; and Mrs. Doyle doubled
her money. So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you asked a gypsy woman what to do
with your money, and she stole it?&rdquo; Florence
sighed. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to go and find that
gypsy woman and get the money back. It
will be difficult. It may be dangerous. Are
you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; The weary woman reached for
her coat. &ldquo;But you?&rdquo; She held back. &ldquo;Why
should you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s part of my job.&rdquo; Florence forced
a laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in a day&rsquo;s work. So&mdash;come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were away, but not until Florence had
placed upon the walls of her memory a picture
of three smiling children&rsquo;s faces. &ldquo;These,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;shall be my inspiration, come
what may!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Their search for the gypsy was rewarded
with astonishing speed. Scarcely had they
rounded a corner to enter noisy and crowded
Maxwell Street than the widow DeLane
gripped Florence&rsquo;s arm to whisper, &ldquo;There!
There she is! That&rsquo;s her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence found herself staring at a dark
and evil face. The woman was powerfully
built. There was about her a suggestion of
crouching. &ldquo;Like some great cat,&rdquo; Florence
thought as a chill ran up her spine.</p>
<p>That the woman resembled a cat in other
ways was at once apparent. With feline instinct,
she sensed danger without actually
seeing it. Standing, with her eyes turned
away, she gave a sudden start, wheeled half
about, took one startled look, then glided,
with all the agility of a cat, through the
crowd.</p>
<p>Florence might not be as sly as the gypsy,
but she was powerful, and she could stick to
a purpose. With the widow close at her heels,
she crowded between a thin man and a fat
woman, pushed an astonished peddler of
roasted chestnuts into the street, hurdled a
low rack lined with cheap shoes, knocked over
a table piled high with cheap jewelry, to at
last arrive panting before a door that had just
been closed by the gypsy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; She set her teeth tight. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
one lock more or less?&rdquo; Her stout shoulder
hit the door.</p>
<p>Quite taken by surprise by the suddenness
of her success in breaking open the door, she
lost her balance and tumbled into the room,
landing flat on the floor.</p>
<p>She had tumbled before, many, many times.
In fact, she could tumble more times per minute
than anyone in her gym class. Locks and
tumbles were not new to her. She was on her
feet and ready for battle in ten split seconds.</p>
<p>The gypsy woman was not slow. The widow
had followed Florence into the room.
There came a glitter of steel as the gypsy
sprang at her.</p>
<p>But not so fast! As the gypsy&rsquo;s arm swung
high, Florence caught it from behind, gave it
a sudden wrench that brought forth a groan,
then shook it as a dog shakes a rat, until the
needle-pointed stiletto gripped in the murderous
gypsy&rsquo;s hand flew high and wide to sink
into the heart of a gaudy dancing girl hanging
in a frame on the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Whirling about just in time to save herself
from the grip of five girls in gypsy costumes
who swarmed at her, Florence sprang towards
them to scatter them as a turkey might
scatter a bevy of pigeons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the distracted widow had
dashed from the room, screaming, &ldquo;Police!
Police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deprived of her deadly weapon, the gypsy
woman did what harm she could with tooth
and nail. This lasted just long enough for
Florence to receive two ugly scratches down
her right cheek. Then the dark-faced one
found herself lying flat upon her back with
one hundred and sixty pounds of Florence
seated on her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;now rest easy,&rdquo; Florence breathed,
&ldquo;un&mdash;until the police come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo; the woman panted. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t take the money. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give it back.
Let me up. I&rsquo;ll get it back for you. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment there was a stir at the door
and there stood Officer Patrick Moriarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; He grinned at Florence.
&ldquo;They told me someone was being killed. But
if it&rsquo;s you doin&rsquo; the killin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s O. K. You
wouldn&rsquo;t kill nobody that didn&rsquo;t need killin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Patrick&rsquo;s young sisters had attended Florence&rsquo;s
playground classes in the good days
that were gone. More often than was really
necessary, Patrick had looked in to see how
they were getting on.</p>
<p>Now, with a grin, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just be
toddlin&rsquo; along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; said Florence in sudden
fright. &ldquo;This woman stole four hundred dollars.
You&rsquo;ve got to do something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only four hundred?&rdquo; Patrick whistled
through his teeth. &ldquo;Why bother her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he added as a sort of afterthought,
&ldquo;we might take her to the station.
She&rsquo;ll get four years. These gypsies like a
nice soft spot in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman let out an unearthly wail, then
struggled in vain to free herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me,&rdquo; Florence said quietly, &ldquo;that
if I&rsquo;d let her up she&rsquo;d give me the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did?&rdquo; Patrick studied the walls of the
room. &ldquo;Door and both windows right here
in front,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I think we might try
it out. Let her up, and we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once on her feet, the woman was not slow
in digging deep among the folds of her ample
skirts and extracting a roll of bills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo; Patrick took it from her. &ldquo;Ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;forty&mdash;&rdquo;
he counted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s four hundred and
ten! How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ten is mine,&rdquo; the gypsy grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; said Patrick. &ldquo;Your man
got a car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now you take this ten and buy
gas with it. Turn that old car south and keep
it going until the gas is gone. And if I see
your face again on Maxwell Street&mdash;&rdquo; He
made the sign of handcuffs. &ldquo;Mostly honest
people live on Maxwell Street. You don&rsquo;t belong
here. Scram! <i>Scram!</i>&rdquo; He gave her a
sturdy push.</p>
<p>The woman was gone before Florence could
think twice.</p>
<p>Patrick turned to Florence. &ldquo;And now,
when do I sign you up as a lady cop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Oh, never!&rdquo; Florence fingered her
bleeding cheek. &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you think she&rsquo;s
poisonous?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not very poisonous.&rdquo; Patrick smiled.
&ldquo;Just a little antiseptic will fix that up, fine
an&rsquo; dandy. But really,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you should
carry a piece of lead pipe or maybe a gun.
You can&rsquo;t tell what they&rsquo;ll do to you&mdash;you
really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying on the Boulevard from now
on.&rdquo; The big girl&rsquo;s tone carried little conviction.
Truth was, she knew she would do
nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; she said to Frances Ward
two hours later, &ldquo;the widow got her money
back. I got a story, and those three cute kids
will get a fine break for months to come. And
after all,&rdquo; she added soberly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for the
children, the little children, I did it. Everything
we do is for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Frances Ward wiped her glasses
with a shaking hand. &ldquo;Yes, it is always for
the little children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>

<br />LITTLE LADY IN GRAY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Read it! Read it aloud!&rdquo; Vivian Carlson
insisted as Jeanne still stood staring
at the three magic words, <span class="sc">SOME CONSIDERABLE
TREASURE</span>, that stood out at the center of
the note they had found in the ancient churn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;alright, I will.&rdquo; With considerable
effort Jeanne pulled herself together. She
was all atremble, as who would not be if he
had succeeded in unscrewing the fastenings
of an ancient churn, lost half a century, to
find inside, as it seemed, a message from the
dead?</p>

voice, &ldquo;am obliged to leave this cabin on the
island. It is the dead of winter. I have but
a small boat. However, because wild creatures
have consumed my supplies, I must endeavor
to reach the mainland. In this churn
will be found a sample of such copper as
abounds on this island. Be it known to any
who open this churn that there is on the island
<i>some considerable treasure</i>. It is to be found
on the Greenstone Ridge at the far side, in a
grotto which may be found by lining up the
outstanding rocks off shore with the highest
point of the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some considerable treasure!&rdquo; Violet
breathed softly. &ldquo;Jewels and gold hidden
there by lake pirates perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or old silver plate smuggled here from
Canada,&rdquo; Jeanne suggested. She loved ancient
dishes and silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;d ever dream
of,&rdquo; said practical Vivian. &ldquo;A curious sort of
treasure I&rsquo;d guess, for this Josiah Grier, if I
guess right, was a queer sort of chap. Think
of hiding a piece of copper worth about two
dollars and a half in an old churn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time do you suppose he could have
belonged to?&rdquo; Violet asked thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Was he a trader when the Indians owned the
island, or a white copper miner of a later
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have had a cow,&rdquo; Vivian suggested.
&ldquo;Churns go with cows. There were cows here
in the copper days. Plenty of grass was planted
for them. There is timothy and clover
growing wild today, everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Needless to say the minds of the three girls
were rife with speculation. There in the chilly
seclusion of the museum they pledged one
another to complete secrecy regarding the
whole matter.</p>
<p>They screwed the churn&rsquo;s top back and replaced
everything, leaving the place just as
Jeanne had found it that morning when she
had gone in to work with kerosene on the
rusty fastenings of the old churn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surprise &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Violet whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprise them. Surprise them,&rdquo; the others
echoed.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of the evening conversation
about the roaring fire that, for the
time at least, all thoughts of treasure were
driven from Jeanne&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange about that airplane, D.X.123,&rdquo;
Sandy MacQueen, the reporter, drawled. &ldquo;I
had a sharp reminder of its disappearance
only last month. Sad thing it was, and rather
haunting. A girl with an appealing face, not
sixteen yet I&rsquo;d say, came into the big room of
our newspaper office. Happened I wasn&rsquo;t
busy, so I asked her what she wanted. And
what do you suppose it was she wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The moose-trapper sat up to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said her father had gone way several
years ago, when she was too small to remember
much about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she have to do with the disappearance
of the D.X.123?&rdquo; the moose-trapper
drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing,&rdquo; Sandy replied. &ldquo;And
yet, it is strange. The name of one man who
went in that apparently ill-fated plane was
John Travis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;John Travis!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know&mdash;&rdquo; Sandy turned to Jeanne.
&ldquo;That girl Florence got interested in&mdash;her
name was Travis too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June Travis,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Sandy, &ldquo;it may be a mere
coincidence. Yet I sort of feel that he might
have been her father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The D.X.123. June Travis,&rdquo; Jeanne was
thinking. &ldquo;John Travis, D.X.123.&rdquo; Her mind
was in a whirl. Springing to her feet, she
seized Vivian by the shoulders. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo;
she said in a strange tight little voice, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
going for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing on their heaviest wraps, the two
girls went out into the night. The storm
which had been raging all that day had
passed. All about them as they walked was
whiteness and silence. The stars were a million
diamonds set in a cushion of midnight
blue.</p>
<p>They took the trail that led across the narrow
entrance to the frozen bay. From the
shore a half mile away came a ceaseless roar.
Lashed into foam by the fury of the storm,
the lake&rsquo;s waters were beating against the
barrier of ice that lay before it.</p>
<p>They walked rapidly forward in silence.
Jeanne felt that she would burst if she did
not talk; yet she said never a word. What
she wanted to say was, &ldquo;Vivian, that girl June
Travis is a friend of mine. Her father is dead.
We must send a wireless message to her. I
saw her father&rsquo;s airplane at the bottom of that
little lost lake. It must have been there for
years. He must be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Strangely enough, she said never a word
about the matter. An unseen presence seemed
to hover over her, whispering, &ldquo;Do not say it!
Do not say it! It may not be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was it true? Jeanne could not tell.</p>
<p>At last they came to a spot where they
might mount to an icy platform and witness
the blind battling of mighty waters against
an unbreakable barrier.</p>
<p>The moon came out from behind a cloud.
Water was black with night and white with
foam. A cavern of ice lay before them. Into
this narrow cavern a giant wave rushed. Its
black waters were churned into white foam.
It rose to stretch out a white hand and to
utter a hiss that was like the angry spit of a
serpent. In sheer terror Jeanne shrank back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t reach us!&rdquo; Vivian threw back her
strong young shoulders and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian!&rdquo; Jeanne suddenly gripped her
companion&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Do you see that ridge?&rdquo;
She pointed away toward the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian, tomorrow, whether it storms or
not, you must go with me to the top of that
ridge and down on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To find the treasure told about in the old
churn?&rdquo; Vivian asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! No!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed in
shocked surprise. &ldquo;It is something more important
than that&mdash;far, far more important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; her voice dropped. &ldquo;I may not
tell you about it now, for, after all, it may be
just nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, with Vivian lost in a haze of stupefaction,
she said with a shudder, &ldquo;This is too
grand&mdash;all this beauty of the night, all this
surf line power. Come! We must go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did go back to the cheery light,
the cozy warmth of the fisherman&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime, in the far-away city Florence
was meeting with an experience well
calculated to make her believe in witches,
fairies, and all manner of fantastic fortune
telling as well. She and June Travis had gone
to visit the little lady in gray.</p>
<p>Florence had, after a considerable effort,
contacted the little lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to see me any time tomorrow,&rdquo; had
been the little lady&rsquo;s invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time tomorrow,&rdquo; Florence had
agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>So, ten o&rsquo;clock next morning found Florence
and June Travis in the vicinity of the
mysterious little lady&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Florence as they alighted
from the car, &ldquo;that anyone interested in
telling fortunes should live in such a rich
neighborhood.&rdquo; She allowed her eyes to take
in three magnificent apartment buildings and
the smaller homes of pressed brick and rich
gray stone that surrounded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I suppose she gets
a great many wealthy clients, and that&rsquo;s what
really pays. And, of course, she may not be
a fortune teller after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over this way,&rdquo; June said, paying little
heed to her companion&rsquo;s talk. She was eager
to reach the little old lady in gray. Some kind
fairy seemed to be whispering in her ear,
&ldquo;This is the one. You have searched long. You
have traveled far. You have met with many
disappointments. But here at last you are,
face to face with reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low
whisper. &ldquo;Such a cute little cottage, all in
gray stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no sign on the door.&rdquo; Florence was
puzzled more and more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>June&rsquo;s fingers trembled as she lifted a heavy
knocker and let it down with a bang that
was startling.</p>
<p>For a short time there was no sign of life
in the place. Then, somewhere inside, a door
opened and shut. The outer door opened, and
there before them stood the Little Lady in
Gray.</p>
<p>She was little&mdash;very small indeed, yet not
really a midget. She was quite gray. And
her dress was as gray as her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; she invited. &ldquo;I have
been expecting you for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; Florence thought with a
sudden start. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t tell her when we&rsquo;d
come&mdash;just said sometime today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are June Travis!&rdquo; said the little
lady. They had been led into the coziest sitting-room
it had ever been Florence&rsquo;s privilege
to see. The little lady looked June up
and down, as much as to say, &ldquo;How you have
grown! And how beautiful you are!&rdquo; She
did not say it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Instead, she pointed to a chair, then to
another as she suggested, &ldquo;If you will kindly
sit there, and you there, I shall take this large
chair, then we can talk. It is a little large,&rdquo;
she looked at the chair that did indeed appear
to have been made for a person three times
her size, &ldquo;but with cushions it can be made
very comfortable indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence wondered in a dreamy sort of way
why so small a person, who apparently could
have anything she wanted, should have
chosen so large a chair. She was destined to
recall this wondering a long time after, and
to wonder still more.</p>
<p>That the little lady <i>was</i> very well off, Florence
was bound to conclude. The curtains
were of finest lace and the draperies of rich,
heavy material. The rugs were oriental. The
few objects of art&mdash;three vases, four oil paintings
and a bronze statue in the corner&mdash;had
cost a pretty penny; yet all this was so arranged
that it appeared to harmonize perfectly
with the two swinging cages where four
yellow canaries swayed and sang, with the
reddish-brown cat that dozed on the narrow
hearth, and with the little lady in that big
chair. It was strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have been wishing, my dear,&rdquo; said
the little lady, &ldquo;to hear some news from your
father&mdash;some good news, to be sure. I have
it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo; June leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; said the little lady, &ldquo;I have
omitted something.&rdquo; She touched a bell. A
tiny maid in a white cap appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tea, Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little lady folded her hands.</p>
<p>Florence could see that June was tense with
emotion. She herself was greatly excited.
Not so the little old lady. She did everything,
said everything in the spirit of absolute repose
and peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; the girl asked herself.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of all this jumping about
like a grasshopper, screaming like a seagull,
and living all the time as if you were racing
to a fire? Peace&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing to seek,
peace and repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here is the tea.&rdquo; The little lady&rsquo;s eyes
shone. &ldquo;Do you have sugar or lemon? Lemon?
Ah, yes. And you? Lemon also. That makes
us three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; she sipped the tea as if she
were about to say, &ldquo;I had muffins for breakfast.
What did you have?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>What she did say was, &ldquo;I heard from your
father, my dear. It was only the day before
yesterday. Oh, not by mail, nor by wire. Not
even by radio. He is rather far away and, for
the moment, shut off. But I heard. Oh, yes,
my dear, I heard&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled a roguish
smile.</p>
<p>June was staring, eyes wide, ears straining,
taking in every expression, drinking in every
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been out of my circle of influence
for a long, long time,&rdquo; said the little lady.
&ldquo;But now he is not so far. It is an island&mdash;that&rsquo;s
where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what island?&rdquo; June&rsquo;s tongue stuck
to the roof of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my child, it is strange!&rdquo; The little
lady smiled a curious smile. &ldquo;He does not
know, nor do I. It is a very large island, this
I know. He is well. He is not alone. He is
very short of food, but hopes to find more
presently. He will, in time, find his way off
this island. He is convinced of that. And so
am I. And then, my dear, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see him!&rdquo; This came from June as
a cry of joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is my father like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full moment the little lady looked at
her without reply. Then she said, &ldquo;He is
short and rather stout. He is jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Florence whispered in June&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has always been well-to-do,&rdquo; the little
lady went on. &ldquo;Now he may be rich. It is
strange. His thoughts are clouded on that
point. It is as if he had been rich, as if for
the moment great wealth had escaped him,
but that in a short time he hoped to regain it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; her words appeared to fade
away. &ldquo;Now I must ask you to excuse me
from further talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Florence experienced a
peculiar sensation. It seemed to her that with
the fading of the little lady&rsquo;s words she also
faded. She seemed to all but vanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure fancy!&rdquo; Florence shook herself, and
there was the little lady, bright and smiling
as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my child!&rdquo; she was saying to June,
&ldquo;Put up your purse. No money ever is passed
in this room. This place is sacred to loyalty
and friendship, beauty and truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>A moment later the two girls found themselves
once again in the bright sunshine of a
winter&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;is the strangest one
of them all. Or is she one of them at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said June, &ldquo;she is not one of them.&rdquo;
She was thinking of Madame Zaran, of the
voodoo priestess and all the rest. &ldquo;She&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated, &ldquo;she is the spirit of truth. All
she said is true. But how&mdash;&rdquo; her face was
filled with sudden dismay. &ldquo;How are we to
find this large island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Florence with a broad
smile, &ldquo;we shall not be obliged to find the
island. It may find us, or at least your father
may.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />STRANGE TREASURE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian! Look down there!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s
lips were drawn into a tight line as
she pointed to a spot on the smooth frozen
surface of the little lost lake.</p>
<p>It was the day following the storm. All was
clear, bright and silent now. They had
climbed the ridge, those two. Then they had
gone slipping and sliding down the other side.</p>
<p>As Vivian heard Jeanne&rsquo;s words, she gave
her a quick look of sudden surprise. &ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed in a
low, tense tone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. I mustn&rsquo;t!
Just look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further question Vivian dropped
to the frozen surface of Jeanne&rsquo;s little lost
lake, cupped her hands about her eyes and,
for one full moment, lay there flat upon the
ice, looking&mdash;just looking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>To Jeanne those sixty seconds were sixty
hours. &ldquo;That girl June Travis,&rdquo; she was
thinking to herself, &ldquo;expects her father to
come back. Sometimes people have faith to
believe such things. God must give them the
power to believe. But if her father is down
there&mdash;if he has been there for years?&rdquo; She
only half formed this last question, and made
no effort to answer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo; Vivian sprang to her feet with a
suddenness that was startling. &ldquo;I see an airplane
down there. There is a circle on the
right plane and inside the circle is D.X.123!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne uttered a sharp cry. &ldquo;Then it is
true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is true?&rdquo; Vivian demanded. &ldquo;How
did the airplane get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, haltingly, Jeanne told her all she
knew of the D.X.123, and all she suspected
as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo; Vivian&rsquo;s voice was hoarse with
emotion. &ldquo;There is a great beacon light on
Passage Island, four miles off the end of Isle
Royale. It is there to guide passing ships.
But on a night of wild storm song birds,
driven off their course, seeing the beacon and
thinking it a place of refuge, come racing in
to dash out their lives against the thick glass
of the light. The men in that plane must have
thought this little lake a place of refuge, and
found it only a grave!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;just because
the plane is down there is no proof the men
are there also. Only last summer an airplane
went down in Rock Harbor, just ten miles
from here. The plane sank from sight in ten
minutes. But before it sank the two men on
board were rescued and are living still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Once again her voice changed as
she prepared to spring into action. &ldquo;We must
hurry back and tell Sandy about our discovery.
We&rsquo;ll get the short wave at Michigan
Tech. They will relay a message to Sandy&rsquo;s
paper. Just think what a scoop it will be for
him! Can&rsquo;t you see the headline: &lsquo;Plane
D.X.123 found at bottom of small lake on Isle
Royale!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne spoke slowly, &ldquo;I can see that.
I can see more than that. I can see the face
of my friend June Travis when she reads that
headline. Her father left in that airplane,
Vivian. Her father! She may not know all
about it, but when she reads that name, John
Travis, she will know. But, Vivian, newspapers
are often cruel. We must not let
Sandy&rsquo;s paper be cruel; at least, please not
yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;alright, Jeanne.&rdquo; Vivian put her
strong arm about Jeanne&rsquo;s waist and together
they made their way across the lake to the
foot of the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; said Vivian as they left the lake,
&ldquo;I wonder how long paint keeps its color at
the bottom of a lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who knows?&rdquo; Strangely enough,
there was a fresh note of hope in Jeanne&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>As they reached the crest of the ridge,
Jeanne turned back. Her gaze took in not the
lake alone, but the lower ridge beyond that,
a broad stretch of lower land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said, pointing to the distant
shore. &ldquo;Smoke below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; There was a puzzled expression
on Vivian&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Whose fire can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does no one live there?&rdquo; asked Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one. There is a cabin there. It was
owned by an Indian, John Redfeather. He
died two years ago. All his stuff is in the
cabin, nets for fishing, canned goods, salt fish
in kegs, everything. But, until this moment,
I believed we people at Chippewa Harbor
were the only ones on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian!&rdquo; Jeanne gripped her arm hard.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Vivian read her meaning. &ldquo;How
could they? No one could live on this island
for years without being seen. Small boats are
going around the island all summer long. No,
no! It is impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; her voice softened. &ldquo;Those
people probably <i>are</i> in trouble. They may
have been driven across the lake in a small
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
a large flat rock and over there are some small
dead trees. Those people may not know we
are at Chippewa Harbor. We will build a
beacon fire to let them know they are not
alone. Then perhaps they will come over and
we can help them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Jeanne thought as she assisted
in laying the fire, &ldquo;I still have faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; said Vivian as a half hour later
the fire, which had blazed high, was a mass
of glowing coals, &ldquo;we are only a short distance
from the highest spot on the ridge. In
a sort of cave beneath that spot is to be found
&lsquo;<i>some considerable treasure</i>.&rsquo; Shall we go look
for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>It was Vivian who talked most of the mysterious
&ldquo;treasure&rdquo; she and Jeanne were about
to seek in the cave-like opening of the rocks
on Greenstone Ridge. And why not? Had it
not been she who, while lifting her father&rsquo;s
nets, had taken the ancient churn from the
bottom of Lake Superior? Had she not cherished
it as a mark of Isle Royale&rsquo;s colorful
history? Had she not, with Jeanne&rsquo;s aid, discovered
the note telling of that treasure?
What was most important of all, Jeanne had
insisted that if anything of value were found
it should be sold and added to Vivian&rsquo;s boat
fund.</p>
<p>Vivian was saying as they made their way
along the ridge toward its highest point: &ldquo;I
know just the boat we need. It was made by
a famous old boat builder. He built it for his
own use. He was old. His sight failed him.
He never put it in the water. He is quite poor
now. If he can sell his boat, how happy he
will be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how happy you and Violet will be!&rdquo;
said Jeanne, suddenly coming out of a brown
study. She was still thinking of the lost airplane
D.X.123 and of that mournful sight
both she and Vivian had seen at the bottom of
the little lost lake, the sunken plane.</p>
<p>At the same time she was thinking of that
column of smoke rising from the edge of a
tiny island along the farther shore of Isle
Royale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How much it
has meant to man through all the years! How
he has read the meaning of its upward curlings.
If he is wise, it tells him of wind and
approaching storm. He signals his distant
friends with columns of smoke. Other columns
warn him of hiding enemies. All this
is of the past. How little that distant smoke
says to me! And yet, somehow, I cannot help
but feel&mdash;&rdquo; she spoke aloud&mdash;&ldquo;that somehow
that smoke is connected with the missing airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how that could be,&rdquo; replied
Vivian. &ldquo;All that must have happened years
ago. No one could live undiscovered on this
island all that time&mdash;not even if he chose to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne did not finish. Her
thoughts at that moment were for herself
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think, Jeanne!&rdquo; Vivian exclaimed.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Some considerable treasure.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what
we read in that note. Think back over the history
of our island. Lake pirates are believed
to have hidden away in our long, narrow harbors.
Of course, that was years and years ago.
But think of the ancient gold and silver plate,
the jewels they may have hidden here!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then&mdash;&rdquo; she sighed a happy sigh of
anticipation. &ldquo;It may not have been that at
all. This island is only sixteen miles from
Canada. Think what a hiding place it must
have been when smugglers were chased by
revenue cutters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they smuggle?&rdquo; Jeanne asked
absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silks, woolens, drugs, opium, uncut diamonds
and&mdash;oh, lots of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silks would rot. Who wants opium? I&rsquo;m
not sure I could tell an uncut diamond from
a pebble.&rdquo; Jeanne laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; Vivian exclaimed, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
the highest spot! Now we go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; Jeanne looked with dismay
upon the sheer wall of rock beneath her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Vivian gripped the out-growing
root of a tree, swung into space, tucked
her toe into a crevice, caught at a sapling
clinging to the rocky wall, found a narrow
shelf, then dropped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jeanne!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Here it is! Here&rsquo;s
the very place! All dark and spooky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne wailed, &ldquo;and here am I. I&mdash;I
just can&rsquo;t come down there! Makes me
dizzy to think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ll come up and help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short time Vivian was
again at her side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in getting used to
it,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always lived here, and
I&rsquo;ve climbed all over. Now when I get down
to that first shelf, you grab that root and slide
over the side. I&rsquo;ll catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With wildly beating heart Jeanne followed
instructions. Three minutes later, to her vast
surprise, she found herself on a lower rocky
shelf looking into a dark cavern that might
well have been called a cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo; She patted
Vivian on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Vivian evidently did not hear this well-deserved
praise. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;now
for the treasure!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">At that moment two men, one with his feet
garbed in crude moccasins made from a torn-up
blanket, were standing on the distant
shore close to a weather-beaten cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; the taller of the two was saying,
&ldquo;that column of smoke is the first sign of
life I&rsquo;ve seen on this island. Who can it be?
Do you suppose they&rsquo;re Indians?&rdquo; They were
speaking of the smoke from Vivian&rsquo;s signal
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re Indians, they&rsquo;re civilized, living
this far south. Probably got a good supply
of food, too, and that&rsquo;s what we need. Stuff
in this cabin is about gone. Wish I knew what
island this is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; the other said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to
get up there and down on the other side,
where they live. We&rsquo;d better start as soon as
possible. Be dark before we get over the
ridge, as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start at once,&rdquo; the other agreed.
Then they disappeared into the cabin.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Treasure!&rdquo; Jeanne was saying at that moment.
&ldquo;He called that treasure&mdash;four big
slabs of copper beaten out of the rocks, probably
by Indians, and hidden here perhaps two
hundred years ago. It may go well in your
museum, but how is it going to help with that
boat of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t help much,&rdquo; Vivian agreed with
a sigh.</p>
<p>Flashlights in hand, they had entered the
rocky cavern. It was neither very wide nor
deep. Well toward the back of it they had
come upon these irregular slabs of pure copper.
The marks of fire and Indians&rsquo; stone
hammers were still to be seen upon them.
Here at least was proof that wild tribes did
mine copper here in centuries gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copper,&rdquo; said Vivian slowly, &ldquo;is worth
eight cents a pound, if you have it near a
smelter. Up here it is worth very little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there have been times,&rdquo; she added in
defense of the unknown one who had left
that note in the ancient churn, &ldquo;when this
pile of copper would have been considered a
treasure. It would have sold for two hundred
dollars, and that much money would buy a
house in a city, or a pretty good farm, way
back in the long ago. It all depends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, for at that moment
Jeanne exclaimed from the deepest and narrowest
corner of the cavern: &ldquo;Vivian! Come
here quick! See what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; Vivian cried. &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;
Her flashlight played over a narrow shelf-like
ledge of rock. On that shelf rested several
pieces of crockery.</p>
<p>These were not like any Vivian had seen
before. Moulded from bluish clay, then fired
to a bright glaze, they bore on their sides
strange markings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pictured crockery,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.
&ldquo;Seems strange that Indians should have done
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet they must have been Indians,&rdquo;
Vivian replied. &ldquo;Who else could have made
them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And oh, Jeanne!&rdquo; she cried with sudden
enthusiasm. &ldquo;What an addition they will
make to my museum collection!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Jeanne said thoughtfully, &ldquo;if
these could have been the treasure referred
to in that note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure? These?&rdquo; Vivian laughed a
merry laugh. &ldquo;Pieces of old crockery! But,&rdquo;
she added thoughtfully, &ldquo;they <i>are</i> a treasure,
of a sort. Come on. I&rsquo;ll take off my mackinaw
and pack them in it. We&rsquo;ll have to handle
them with care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, just as dusk was falling,
they crept out of the cave. After a quarter
hour spent in struggling up the steep rocky
wall, they went hurrying down the slope toward
home.</p>
<p>At the same time two men, one who limped
and one who wore rags for shoes, were struggling
across the narrow plateau where snow
lay deep and wolf tracks were numerous, toward
that steep wall of rock in which the
cavern was hidden.</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s question regarding the pieces of
ancient crockery proved not to be so far
wrong after all. The moment Sandy MacQueen
saw them he exclaimed &ldquo;What a discovery!
Until this moment not a whole piece
of Indian crockery has been found on the
island, only fragments. And now, here you
have a dozen or more perfect ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what is this?&rdquo; He fairly leaped at
one piece. &ldquo;Here is the picture of that heathen
god Thor! Can&rsquo;t be any mistake about
it. Why would Indians put such a picture on
their crockery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; His face beamed. &ldquo;I may
be wrong, but if I&rsquo;m not, this will go far toward
proving a story that until now has
seemed more than half legend&mdash;that Norsemen,
driven to the shores of America, perhaps
a thousand years ago, came to this island for
protection from savage Indians, and that they
were the true discoverers of copper on Isle
Royale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian! Violet!&rdquo; His tone was low, exciting.
&ldquo;You have your summer boat paid for
right now! I know a museum curator who
will pay you handsomely for these pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I sort of wanted them for my museum,&rdquo;
Vivian demurred. &ldquo;But the boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the boat!&rdquo; Violet exclaimed. &ldquo;The
boat! The boat!&rdquo; At that she grabbed Vivian
and Jeanne both at once and together they
went whirling madly around the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />THROUGH THE PICTURE</h2>
<p>Florence was in the studio alone. Miss
Mabee had been called away to New
York. The fire in the hearth had burned out.
Florence had not troubled to rebuild it. The
place seemed cold, lonely, deserted. As she
sat there musing, she seemed to hear the
words of Poe&rsquo;s Raven: &ldquo;Never more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never more what? Well, surely never again
would she believe in those who told fortunes
by reading cards, gazing into a crystal ball,
or studying stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fakers all,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Simple,
harmless people, most of them; but fakes for
all that! They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off to listen. Had she
caught some sound of movement in the room?
It did not seem possible. The door was securely
locked. The door? Two doors really.
She recalled discovering a secret panel door
at the side of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just behind that picture,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>The picture, on which she bestowed a fleeting
glance, was the one Miss Mabee had prepared
for the little show to be put on for Tum
Morrow&rsquo;s benefit, the paper picture through
which Jeanne was supposed to jump. &ldquo;Wonder
if that show will ever come off?&rdquo; she
mused. &ldquo;Wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet. This time there <i>was</i>
a sound. Yes, and she wanted to scream.
There, between two paintings of gypsy life,
was a face, an ugly, fat, leering face. She
knew that face. It was the man she had seen
in the professor&rsquo;s room on that night when
she went down the rope. Madame Zaran had
sent him. Her illicit business of telling fake
fortunes was being ruined by Florence&rsquo;s investigations
and reports. She was seeking revenge.</p>
<p>How had the man entered the room? One
other question was more pressing: how was
she to get out?</p>
<p>The man was between her and the entrance.
He was close to the stairway that led
to the balcony. She was trapped&mdash;or was she?
There was the secret panel door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That picture is directly in front of it,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Too close. I can&rsquo;t get round
it. But I could&mdash;&rdquo; her heart skipped a beat.
&ldquo;I could go through it. Too bad to spoil
Tum&rsquo;s big party too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was advancing upon her. With
hands outstretched, eyes gleaming, he seemed
some monstrous beast about to seize a bird
of rare plumage.</p>
<p>She hesitated no longer. She sprang to the
right, then dashed three steps forward to go
crashing through that picture.</p>
<p>Was the man taken by surprise? Beyond
doubt he was. At any rate, Florence was
through that door and had completely lost
herself in a maze of slanting beams and rafters
before she had time to think of her next
move. And from the studio there came no
sound.</p>
<p>She could not well go back, even though
she knew the way, so she groped forward.
After ten minutes of this, she caught a gleam
of light. It came from under a door. Remembering
that nearly all the people in the
world are decent, honest folks, she knocked
boldly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>The door was thrown open. There, framed
in light, stood Tum Morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tum!&rdquo; she exclaimed, all but falling into
his arms. &ldquo;Tum! How glad I am to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; He
stared in surprise. &ldquo;Come on in and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story was soon told. &ldquo;And Tum,&rdquo;
Florence ended with a note of dismay, &ldquo;I
ruined that picture! I had to. That puts an
end to your big show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that trouble you.&rdquo; The boy
smiled happily. &ldquo;Only yesterday Miss Mabee
fixed up something quite wonderful for me.
She has a friend, a director of music in a
college. He wants someone to play the part
of concertmeister in his orchestra and direct
the strings in their practice. I have been given
a musical scholarship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to college! How grand!
Shake!&rdquo; Florence held out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand enough,&rdquo; Tum agreed. &ldquo;Now, however,
you are the burning question of the hour.
How and when are you going back to the
studio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How and when?&rdquo; Florence repeated
gloomily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; Tum exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a gun&mdash;a regular cannon. My dad used it in
the war. Suppose we load it up and march on
the enemy. If necessary, I&rsquo;ll play the &lsquo;Anvil
Chorus&rsquo; on that old cannon, and there may
be less trouble in the world after I am
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand idea! Lead the way!&rdquo; Florence was
on her feet.</p>
<p>By a secret passage known only to Tum,
they made their way to the studio entrance.
Their expected battle, however, did not come
off. They found the studio silent and quite
deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stack our arms, pitch our tents, build
a fire and&mdash;&rdquo; Tum hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And serve rations,&rdquo; Florence finished for
him with a laugh.</p>
<p>Florence was a good cook. Tum was a good
eater, and, if the truth must be told, so was
Florence. The quantities of food consumed
there by the fire was nothing short of scandalous.
But then, who was there to complain?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Florence settled back in her big
chair at last. &ldquo;The enemy marched on us tonight.
Tomorrow we shall march on the enemy.
I&rsquo;ll hunt up Patrick Moriarity. He&rsquo;ll
call in a police squad. We&rsquo;ll raid Madame
Zaran&rsquo;s place. Yes, and we&rsquo;ll call on the voodoo
priestess as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voodoo priestess and Madame Zaran&mdash;are
they friends?&rdquo; Tum asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from that.&rdquo; Florence sat up in her
chair. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the bitterest enemies. You
see, they&rsquo;re both engaged in the same crooked
game. Each hoped to reap a rich harvest from
June Travis&rsquo; innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find out all that?&rdquo; Tum
stared at her with frank admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve guessed it for some time. Two days
ago I proved it.&rdquo; Florence was away with a
good story. &ldquo;I felt quite sure that the voodoo
priestess was reared in Chicago, not in the
Black Republic of Haiti. To prove this was
very simple.&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;You see, Haiti
used to be a French colony. Even today everyone
down there speaks French. So, too,
would a real voodoo priestess from that
island. On my last visit to her I took along
a friend who speaks French fluently. I had
instructed her to talk French to me in this
black woman&rsquo;s presence. More than that, she
was to say things like this: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a humbug.
She is a big black impostor!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Tum, &ldquo;must have got a rise
out of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it.&rdquo; Florence laughed again.
&ldquo;She got mad, but not at what we said. She
objected to the way we said it. She couldn&rsquo;t
understand a word of French, that&rsquo;s sure, for
we had hardly started when she turned on
us, her eyes bulging with anger as she said,
&lsquo;Here, you! Don&rsquo;t you dare speak none of
that ugly foreign stuff in dis place! De spirit
of de big black Emperor, he objects!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed,
&ldquo;French was probably the only language her
big black Emperor ever spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; she went on after a while, &ldquo;I
asked her why she didn&rsquo;t gaze into a crystal
ball, the way Madame Zaran did. I told her
of the moving figures I had seen in Madame&rsquo;s
glass ball. I said Madame would probably
get all of June&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time I was talking she was getting
blacker and blacker with anger. And the
things she said about Madame Zaran! They
couldn&rsquo;t be put in a book, I can tell you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the things, though, were interesting,
for I am sure she does the same things
herself. She said that when Madame Zaran
has a rich patron she bribes a maid in the
patron&rsquo;s home, a hair-dresser or someone else,
to tell all about her. Then when the rich
patron returns for a reading, don&rsquo;t you see,
she can tell her the most amazing things
about her past? Oh, they&rsquo;re a great pair, the
priestess and Madame Zaran. I&rsquo;d like to be
around if they met in a dark spot at night.
But I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Florence sighed, &ldquo;for tomorrow
is our zero hour. When the police are through
with them, they&rsquo;ll be in no fighting mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather guess not!&rdquo; said Tum. Then, &ldquo;If
you feel things are O. K. I&rsquo;ll be going. Keep
my cannon if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo; Florence put out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Tum, &ldquo;the way you
play the &lsquo;Anvil Chorus&rsquo; on it, you just grip it
here, pull on this little trigger with your forefinger,
and it does the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks! And good-night.&rdquo; Florence
flashed him a dazzling smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />A VISIT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Excitement regarding the discovery
of that ancient pottery was all over when,
at a rather late hour that night, Jeanne crept
beneath the blankets in the chilly little room
under the rafters in the fisherman&rsquo;s cabin on
Isle Royale.</p>
<p>As she lay there in the darkness and silence
that night brings, she thought again of the
startling news Vivian had wanted to flash
out over her tiny radio station to all the world,
the word that the airplane D.X.123 had been
found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivian will not send it until I say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she assured herself. &ldquo;She is the kind of girl
who can keep a secret&mdash;a really true friend.
And yet, I wonder if I have the right to ask
her to remain silent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes, she saw again the
wistful, almost mournful look on the face of
June Travis. Then she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>She did not sleep long. She was wakened
by loud banging on the cabin door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us in!&rdquo; a voice called huskily.</p>
<p>A light appeared, reflected on the roof
above Jeanne&rsquo;s head. She heard the fisherman
say, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught the answer clear and plain: &ldquo;I
am John Travis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Jeanne was listening to
the strange, all but unbelievable story of John
Travis, who was, in very truth, the father of
her friend June.</p>
<p>Relying upon the word of a dying veteran
prospector, John Travis and a friend, who was
an air pilot, had flown far into the north of
Canada in quest of gold.</p>
<p>They had discovered gold, but had disabled
their plane. The story of the years that followed
was one of hardships, failure and final
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There we were,&rdquo; the voice of John Travis
went on, &ldquo;with our plane wrecked in the heart
of a frozen wilderness.&rdquo; He stared at the
glowing hearth as if he would see again that
great white emptiness, hear again the wail of
those rushing northern gales.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had food for a year. But where were
we? We could not tell. We began exploring.
Little by little, we widened our circle until
one day I came upon a low falls where the
water ran so swiftly that even in winter it
was not frozen over. And at the edge of that
falls, where a low eddy had deposited it, was
a handful of sand.&rdquo; He took a long breath.
&ldquo;In that sand there was a gleam of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who has not felt it&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke slowly.
&ldquo;He who has not lived in the North can tell
nothing of what the call of the North is, nor
the grip the search for gold gets upon your
very soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did we not come back sooner? How
could one leave one&rsquo;s own people so long,
desert an only child? Gold!&rdquo; He clenched his
knotty hands tight. &ldquo;Gold! We had found
gold. At first it was only a little. As days,
months passed, we found more and more. And
always, always&mdash;&rdquo; The gleam of a gambler
shone in his eyes as he spread his hands wide.
&ldquo;Always, just before us, like a mirage on the
desert, was the motherlode, the pocket of gold
where nuggets were piled in one great heap.
We would find it tomorrow&mdash;tomorrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; he repeated softly. &ldquo;Gold. It&rsquo;s all
there in the cabin of that plane at the bottom
of that little lost lake. We&rsquo;ll lift the plane
and the gold when the spring thaw comes.
And then, my child, my June shall be rich.
And you, my friends&mdash;&rdquo; his eyes swept the
little circle, &ldquo;you shall not go unrewarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of the peril to June,&rdquo; Jeanne said
in a low, serious tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left her in good hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now she is a young lady, sixteen. Her
birthday&mdash;is it the twenty-first? That must
be very soon. Then she gets her money. And
money means danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money&mdash;danger?&rdquo; The man brushed his
hand before his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me finish. Indians came, fine
bronze-faced fellows we could trust. We gave
them gold, bound them to secrecy by an oath
known only to their tribe, and hired them to
bring us food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So the years passed until, one day, a plane
came zooming in from the south. And at the
sight of men of our own race, somehow our
blood got on fire. As they talked of cities, of
bright lights and music, of pictures, dancing
and song, of autos and airplanes and all our
great country&rsquo;s progress, my heart seemed
ready to burst with the desire to become a
part of it all again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed once more, &ldquo;they flew
away to return a little later with parts for
our plane. We paid them with our gold mine,
what there is left of it. We sailed away into
the blue with our gold. We were headed for
Chicago and would have made it, too, if fog
hadn&rsquo;t caught us. It did catch us, as you
know. We tried to land on ice. We were
successful. We were saved. But the ice gave
way, the plane sank!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo; he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Now
we are safe again. And soon, please God, I
shall be with my child again. And this time
I am ready to swear it on the open Bible, I
shall never again leave her alone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until now,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;we did not know
where we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you know!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed.
&ldquo;Soon all the world shall know. Vivian!
Sandy! The radio! We are to be the bearers
of good tidings, of great joy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />IN WHICH SOME THINGS ARE WELL FINISHED</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just get the janitor to go up
with us,&rdquo; said Patrick Moriarity as
he and Florence arrived at the building in
which Madame Zaran conducted her readings.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone, more than likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they were. The room, as they approached
it, was dark and appeared deserted.</p>
<p>As, under police orders, the janitor opened
the door, Florence once again felt a thrill run
up her spine. In her mind she felt again, as
on that first day, the grip of those bony fingers
on her shoulders. Once again she saw
the shadow against those midnight blue draperies&mdash;the
shadow of &ldquo;Satan&rdquo;&mdash;this time in
imagination alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deserted as a tomb,&rdquo; was Patrick&rsquo;s conclusion.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have a look.&rdquo; Florence
had told him of all the strange doings that
had gone on here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he muttered as they came
upon a narrow stairway hidden among the
draperies.</p>
<p>Together they mounted the stairs to arrive
at a still narrower platform. Here on a
stand they discovered a small moving-picture
projector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe it would be that,&rdquo; was
Patrick&rsquo;s only comment as he focused the
machine, then turned on the motor.</p>
<p>To Florence&rsquo;s vast surprise, the crystal ball,
reposing on the table on the floor below, at
once became alive. On its gleaming surface
tiny human figures began to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite simple,&rdquo; was the young officer&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;Moving pictures focused upon a
small screen behind the ball&mdash;that&rsquo;s all it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they made the pictures especially for
their&mdash;their clients!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone spoke
her astonishment. &ldquo;Posed people made up to
look like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather costly, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo; said Patrick. &ldquo;But
then, they were playing for big stakes. I
have no doubt they&rsquo;ve played their little game
before, perhaps many times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said a moment later, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go
have a look on this black priestess of yours.
We may find her at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did find the priestess, and many more
besides. In fact, there had been quite an affair
at her studio that very morning. Truth
was, as Florence, leaning on Patrick&rsquo;s arm,
looked in upon the scene, she thought there
had been nothing quite like it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a scene on the stage,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cold gray dawn of the morning after,&rdquo;
Patrick murmured.</p>
<p>And indeed that was just what it looked to
be. In the center of the room, her hands still
clawing as if for unearned gold, Madame
Zaran stood leaning on a table. She seemed
dizzy. The reason was a rapidly swelling
bruise on her forehead. At her feet lay her
thick-necked guard, he who had entered the
studio on the previous night. He was out for
good. So, too, were two black men in one
corner. As for the Professor and the voodoo
priestess, they were seated upon the floor,
staring at one another for all the world like
two spent wrestlers pausing to regain their
breath. As Florence and the young officer
stood there looking on in stupefied silence, a
black goat with golden horns appeared from
somewhere. He let out a loud b-a-a, then
charged the unfortunate Madame Zaran. He
hit her behind the knees, and she collapsed
like an empty sack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; Patrick drawled, &ldquo;as if
there had been a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure does look that way,&rdquo; said a strange
voice.</p>
<p>Florence whirled about to find herself looking
into a face that resembled a new moon&mdash;large
thin nose, sharp protruding chin, eyes
that bulged slightly. &ldquo;The Devil,&rdquo; she
thought without saying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me before.&rdquo; The man favored
her with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;ve seen your shadow more
than once,&rdquo; the girl managed to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handy sort of shadow,&rdquo; the man chuckled.
&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m a city detective. I&rsquo;ve been on
this case for some time. Now it would seem
that all that&rsquo;s needed is an ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call one,&rdquo; Patrick said, hurrying away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, the whole company,
including the goat, were on their way to the
police station. Shortly thereafter, the greater
number of them were transferred to the hospital.</p>
<p class="tb">Of quite a different nature was the meeting
in Miss Mabee&rsquo;s studio two days later.</p>
<p>They were gathered there in the studio,
Florence and June, Miss Mabee, Tum Morrow
and Rodney Angel, when there came the
sound of footsteps on the stairs, followed by
a rattle at the bell. June started forward impulsively.
Florence held her back. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
she whispered.</p>
<p>Miss Mabee pressed a button. The door
opened slowly, and in walked Sandy, Jeanne
and a short, stout man. They, the newcomers,
all wore heavy airplane coats and carried airplane
traveling bags in their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; The man studied the waiting
group. When his eyes fell upon June they
lighted up as if by a touch of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June!&rdquo; His voice was husky. &ldquo;How big!
How beautiful you are!&rdquo; Next instant the
girl was in his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>And after that, as always, there was a feast.
At this feast John Travis made a brief speech.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gold on Isle Royale.&rdquo; He spoke
with feeling. &ldquo;More gold at the bottom of
that little lake than any man can use wisely
in a lifetime. When it&rsquo;s been recovered, I
shall charter the finest airplane in the country
and take you all on a trip around the world.
What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, they said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and they said
it with a shout of joy. But would they go?
Only time could tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fortune telling,&rdquo; Florence said to
June as they lunched together next day, &ldquo;It
is all a fake and a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we say of the little lady in
gray?&rdquo; June asked, as she opened her eyes
wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, &ldquo;that <i>was</i> strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go and see her again and&mdash;and
thank her.&rdquo; The younger girl&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go this very afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did, and with the most astonishing
results. They were met at the door by a
very large lady. &ldquo;Large enough,&rdquo; Florence
thought with a start, &ldquo;to occupy that huge
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;d like to see the little lady in
gray,&rdquo; June said timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have the wrong number.&rdquo; The
large lady looked at them in surprise. &ldquo;There
is no one here but me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there <i>was</i>!&rdquo; June insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken!&rdquo; In the woman&rsquo;s voice
there was a positive note none would care to
dispute. &ldquo;I live here alone with my cat and
canaries. There never has been anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June opened her mouth to speak again, but
Florence was pulling at her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;This must
be the wrong address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; June insisted when they were
once more on the sidewalk. &ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo; Florence smiled in a strange
way. &ldquo;But when some fairy godmother borrows
a house for a morning just so she can
give you some very good news, you don&rsquo;t go
right ahead and give her away, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Florence, finally, &ldquo;I am
through with mysteries for a long, long time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was she? If you wish to know, you must
